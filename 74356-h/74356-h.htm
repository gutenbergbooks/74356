<p><i>Those who have been content to regard the
cat merely, æsthetically, as a household ornament,
economically, as a mouse-killer, or
fantastically, as an adjunct of witchcraft, will
doubtless read this book with some surprise.
For Svend Fleuron has imagined (or observed)
a cat more or less cut off from relationship
with men, bringing up her kittens
in the fields, against all the odds that any wild
animal, surrounded by the destructive terrors
of nature, has to face. If this novel
were a true picture of human life, it would
show, relentlessly and bitterly, how nature
overcame the mother and her children. As,
however, it is a picture of cat life, the end is
a happy one. Grey Puss is successful in the
struggle and so are all her kittens. “The
other farm cats’ kittens were born in barn and
loft and were drowned litter after litter—but
she would see that her kittens grew to be
cats.”</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p><i>In spite of the complete veracity of this
chronicle, I can realize the shock which the
book offers to those uninformed or insensitive
persons who persist in regarding the cat as a
soft plaything or a decorative coward, for,
without a touch of sentimentality, Fleuron
has very strikingly portrayed the courage,
the resourcefulness, the patience, and the
independence of Grey Puss and her multicoloured
brood. They are forced to battle
for their food, to compete with the crow and
the owl, to fight the fox; they are maltreated
by the farmhands and pursued by the dog,
Box; even their father makes a frustrated attempt
to eat them; but they emerge triumphantly
and each kitten, in his own manner,
succeeds in making his way in the world. It
is well to remember that the picture is not
extraordinary or the case abnormal. Eighty
out of every hundred cats, who grow up, make
their way valiantly under similar disheartening
circumstances.</i></p>

<p><i>Just as certain tame cats sometimes have
decided to leave the hearth for the adventures
of wild life, so Grey Puss, who had once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
been a children’s pet, occasionally, in spite of
rebuffs and the remembered treachery of
man, hankers after domesticity, the milk-pail,
the kitchen stove, and the soft warm hay in
the barn. Several of her kittens, Grey,
White, and Tiny, inherit this vague longing
and eventually settle down in human habitations,
but human beings, on the whole, play
small and entirely inferior rôles in this fine
novel. They seldom step across its pages and
when they do appear, we see, with Grey Puss,
only their feet and their legs as high as the
knee. Box, the dog, a more important character
in this essentially feline drama, is
painted as a good-hearted, blundering brute,
always in trouble, punished for following his
instincts, and finally meeting his end in an
aquatic encounter with the mother heroine.</i></p>

<p><i>The cat as wild animal has been treated in
fiction before, notably by Mary E. Wilkins
in</i> The Cat, <i>by Charles G. D. Roberts in</i>
How a Cat Played Robinson Crusoe, <i>and by
F. St. Mars in</i> Pharaoh. <i>These, however,
are short stories with a single hero. Fleuron
has employed a broader canvas. His sub-title</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
A Family Chronicle, <i>explains his
scheme. He is writing the story of a family.
It would have been easy to confuse kitten
with kitten. Lesser writers in writing about
cats have readily fallen into this error.
Fleuron, however, paints distinct portraits
of each separate puss. Each of these kittens
differs from the others not alone in appearance
but also in character and each is
confronted with the rewards and punishments
of his own vices and virtues. They emerge
at the end of the book as rounded and recognizable
and memorable as any of the characters
in</i> The Way of All Flesh. <i>Striped Big,
“thick-set and sturdy, with short tail, strong
legs, and a back which merged smoothly into
a plump round stomach; big attentive eyes
with intelligence and intensity in their glance;
small ears never at rest ... the master-hunter
of the litter,” who becomes a wild cat
in a deer park; Black, the quarrelsome, who
“returned snarl and spit for kind word—and
he never hit softly on the nose but scratched
so that it hurt,” who battles with crows and
rats, and ends his days in the barracks among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
the soldiers; Tiny, the weather-prophet, a
timorous hanger-on, who becomes the pet of
a midwife; Grey, “with her quiet, thoughtful
nature, who ponders carefully every step she
takes,” catches fish and eventually goes to live
with a fisherman; Red, juggler and hypocrite,
subtle and deceitful, who wins all her triumphs
by stealth; and White, a merry and
friendly kitten, who makes a joke of everything;
neither big nor strong, her grace and
good humour serve to advance her station in
life: these are Svend Fleuron’s</i> Kittens. <i>In
the end, Grey Puss, rid, at length, of the
responsibility of this particular litter, succumbs
again to her prize-fighting lover, the
great piebald hero, that rarety, a male tortoise-shell,
wooed by the soft seduction of the
dream of renewed motherhood. This, to me,
is one of the most delightful episodes in the
history.</i></p>

<p><i>Fleuron’s method is realistic and dramatic.
He devotes comparatively little space to
descriptions of his characters; he tells us what
they do and feel and they do and feel nothing
that it is impossible to imagine cats doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and feeling. Human characteristics are not
ascribed to them. The philosophy inherent
in the book is cat philosophy rather than the
author’s. All this would avail nothing, were
it not obvious to any one who reads a
very few pages that Fleuron has observed
the animal very closely and sympathetically.
Sentimentality is entirely lacking from this
book, as it should be, but sympathy, we may
be sure, is never very far away.</i></p>

<p><i>This novel, I like to believe, will please
W. H. Hudson, who, abhorring the idea of
“pets,” enjoys watching an animal living its
own life, unrestrained. Grey Puss and her
kittens forge their own destinies, create their
own careers, restricted only by their respective
characters and their environment. Their
lives are not regulated by owners or masters.
No more, it is well to remember, are those of
pet cats</i> (<i>The Monsieur Sidi of Côte-Darly
has said truly</i>, Nous sommes des êtres libres,
même dans l’esclavage), <i>but a house-cat is accorded
a certain protection which, perhaps,
softens his real nature. This, then, marks the
great distinction between</i> Kittens <i>and such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
cat biography as Pierre Lôti’s</i> Vies de Deux
Chattes, <i>in which the writer very beautifully
sets down an account of the lives of two of his
cats: those were</i> Lôti’s <i>cats and in his book he
describes, for the greater part, their relations
with</i> him. <i>Grey Puss and her kittens are
observed in their relations with nature.
Their relations with man are recorded from
their point of view rather than his. This is
the new note in this very authentic cat story,
authentic, at least, within the limitations the
author has set himself. In much of the previous
fiction involving the cat, puss has been
handled quite in the manner of a Ouida
duchess</i>; Kittens <i>is the feline</i> Esther Waters.</p>

<b><a id="newlink_21"></a>GREY PUSS</b>
</h3>

<p>The May moon is still shining white and
round in the sky; but eastward beyond
the hills, silhouetting a farmhouse
roof, the first faint light of dawn tinges the
distant horizon.... Along a hedge leading
from the farm a house-cat comes creeping.
At intervals it stops and casts a watchful glance
behind ... then hurries on again.</p>

<p>The advancing day slowly spreads its wakening
touch over the land. In the zenith the
sky is already blue, and the stars are going to
rest; but all human talk and noise is still
buried in the feather-beds of the farm ...
only a mighty vibrating chorus of invisible
larks fills the air.</p>

<p>The animal is apparently quite an ordinary
cat. Its small round head rests on a thick,
shapely neck; the legs are short, the tail round
and smooth, and the curve of the neck graceful
and harmonious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>But on the underside pussy is quite bare and
naked. Her stomach is distended from breast
to groin like an overfilled sack. The cat has
had kittens in her time; the fact cannot be
denied!</p>

<p>The squeak of a mouse from the shadow of
the hedge brings her to an abrupt halt. Her
ears spring to a point and appear all at once
disproportionately large, like those of a rabbit.
In shape they resemble lynx ears more
than a cat’s; the only thing lacking is the tuft.</p>

<p>The night-mists roll slowly from the valleys,
revealing the green, dew-spangled blades
of the fresh spring crop. Along border and
hedge the wild flowers begin to clothe themselves
in the sun’s variegated hues. The colours,
too, in the cat’s coat begin now to be
visible.</p>

<p>She is mouse-grey, with black stockings and
white shoes. But round her breast and sides
runs—like a mark of distinction—a band of
rust-red fur.</p>

<p>Soon Grey Puss resumes her interrupted
journey from the farm; the mouse has been
successfully captured and eaten. At first she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
had been tempted to play with it; but the bark
of a dog from the direction of the farm
brought other thoughts into her head. She no
longer steals along—but runs....</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_23"></a>THE WILLOW STUMPS</b>
</h3>

<p>At the farthest end of the hedge loom three
ancient willow stumps, like monster mushrooms
springing from the ground.</p>

<p>For more than a century they have been
regularly clipped, a process which has given
them weirdly distorted heads. In each of
their bowl-shaped tops is ample room for a
couple of men.</p>

<p>Black ants live in the trunks beneath, and
form paths up the furrowed, moss-covered
bark; on the wind-dried branches and along
the withered twigs the male ants assemble in
swarming-time, giving the group of ancient
trees an extraordinarily lifelike appearance.</p>

<p>But spiders spin their webs from every knot
and curve, and in them ant corpses hang
thickly in bunches. In one stump a redstart
has built its nest; in another, which is big and
full of touchwood, grow burdocks, mugworts,
and nettles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>The old willow stumps are never at rest....
Hairy, yellow-speckled willow-moths
wander all over them from top to root, devouring
the leaves, until, later in the summer, only
the stalks are left—then they spin their cocoons,
and one day rise on their soft white
wings to desert the stripped, maltreated larva-trees,
the ground beneath carpeted with their
filth.</p>

<p>The central stump, the one with fat, crooked
stem, is hollow right down to the bottom.</p>

<p>Outside the entrance to the hole—a split in
the top of the head—grows a large, thick
gooseberry bush, which gives shelter from
the wind and rain, and serves as a perfect door.
Once upon a time the bush must have flown
up here as a seed; now it has developed a long,
thick aerial-root which runs down inside,
clinging to the wooden wall until it reaches its
mouldering base.</p>

<p>In the thorny branches a linnet has built its
circular, down-lined nest—and here the bird
has been sitting fearlessly for eight days and
nights without caring in the least about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
old grey cat, which at this very moment is
squeezing its way through the narrow entrance.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_25"></a>THE KITTENS</b>
</h3>

<p>A shadowy bundle at the bottom of the bole
comes to life: human eyes would have taken it
for a number of mouldering sausages lying
among moss and touchwood.</p>

<p>The she-cat cautiously approaches the bundle,
letting herself down backwards by the
root of the gooseberry bush—at every third
or fourth step uttering a low, soft miauw.</p>

<p>The bundle becomes conscious of her, and
still half asleep, begins to move.</p>

<p>Now a little leg with tiny, extended claws
is stretched into the air, now a sleepy, yawning
head pops into sight. Then the old cat glides
behind the heap and pushes herself carefully
underneath.</p>

<p>The young ones, listening delightedly to the
soft, ingratiating miauws, scent immediately
the spiced milk-nipples and swarm into her
embrace—with relaxed thighs she cuddles still
farther beneath them. They crawl forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
fumbling blindly and seeking to get hold ...
and she purrs to them contentedly a long, long
lullaby.</p>

<p>Outside, the day rises from its cloudy bed on
the horizon. The stork’s cackle resounds
from the farmhouse roof; the bird, emitting a
volley of notes, appears simultaneously on the
top of the chimney like a small black paper
silhouette. Its crackling castenets wake the
farmyard cocks—and now a running fire is
kept up all over the village; <i>cock-a-doodle-do,
cock-a-doodle-do</i>. Small strips of cloud
which seemed before so water-logged and grey
become fleecy and reddish, while the horizon
is filled like a deep dish with the dazzling
shafts of the rising sun.</p>

<p>Above the fields trills the now visible chorus
of larks, and the waking cattle greet the day
with subdued grunts and bellows. Linnets fly
twittering through the air, and a company of
peewits flap like a black, drifting cloud across
the sunlit sky. Along the grass-bordered
wheel-tracks the hare comes hopping, his
stomach stuffed with food, his long ears straddled
wide; the fellow is courting in these days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and has scarcely time for sleep. He squats
down and stares at the big red bull, wondering
where his little, light-footed hare-girl can
have gone. The bull gets up and stretches
himself lazily....</p>

<p>Now the edge of the sun appears behind the
hills; the partridge whirrs and the wild ducks
in the swamp sweep round in circles. Hedge
and fence are thrown into sharp relief, and
thin, crooked shadows from the farm trees
jump up on the white gable of the house.</p>

<p>The horizon is on fire! It is sunrise. The
kittens down in the willow stump have all
found their nipples; they lift their tiny paws
with joy and stretch out their little claws; they
cling greedily to the old she-cat’s body and
nestle warmly in the shelter of her loins.</p>

<p>Big, the largest, now places a forepaw on
either side of his milk-spring, and pushes and
pulls with all <i>his</i> strength, while with distended
nostrils he sucks and squeezes until he
gasps for breath and the milk gurgles in his
throat.</p>

<p>Occasionally one of the kittens, its tiny
tongue licking its small, pointed muzzle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
thrusts up a red nose for a breathing-space.</p>

<p>No mercy is shown! Another kitten at
once seizes the still running nipple—the poor,
greedy one, occupied for the moment in coughing,
must be content temporarily to stand
aside.</p>

<p>The happy little mother lies purring with
delight over her maternal duties—and at intervals,
when one of her little blind children
utters a tiny miauw, she miauws back tenderly
and consolingly.</p>

<p>Old Grey Puss has the sweetest cat-face possible.
The chin and lower lip are white, as
is also the upper lip with its shining whiskers.
But above the slightly mahogany-coloured
snout she seems almost to be wearing a mask.
It is dead black—and gives a veiled, deceitful
look to the gleaming, golden-yellow eyes.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_28"></a>GREY PUSS AND HER PAST</b>
</h3>

<p>She had been the children’s kitten; had been
petted and played with and had free run of
the living-rooms. She could never forget
those wonderful days—and the room there—just
the other side of the threshold, where no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
hen or cock, cow or horse, not even Box himself,
ever set foot—where only “humans” came.
Old as she was, it still lingered in her memory.</p>

<p>Often during the chill of spring or the frost
of winter she would see it hovering above her,
dreamlike, with its endless bowls of milk and
its everlasting summer.</p>

<p>The days of luxury had lasted little more
than a month; after that the command was
“Get out!” And with boot and broomstick
she was ruthlessly expelled.</p>

<p>“Grey Puss is such a thief!” complained
the housewife.... “She is always after the
meat and cream on the kitchen table. Grey
Puss <i>steals</i> ... we can’t have her in the
house!”</p>

<p>What did she know about human laws?
What were meat and cream meant for if not
for a cat?... She took what she could; it
was her nature.</p>

<p>After being expelled from the house she
began to avoid people; soon the habit became
second nature. From the house she was
chased to the farmyard, from the farmyard
to the cow-stall.... The smoke from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
chimney was now the only thing in sight to
remind her of her childhood’s luxury.</p>

<p>She was often to be found of a summer
morning basking in the sun outside the stall.
Together with the other she-cats of the farm
she lay here giving suck to a motherless kitten.
They shared the child between them, and fed
it alternately, listening the while for the return
of the milk-cart from the fields.</p>

<p>Now they hear it in the distance—yes, that
is old Whitefoot’s trot! And soon afterwards
it rattles and bumps into the yard. All the
cats’ tails rise straight in the air like trees;
their legs grow quite stiff—the great event
of the day is at hand.</p>

<p>The cart has barely stopped before they are
up in it; they must immediately sniff the odour
of the sweet, fresh milk.</p>

<p>The foreman of the dairy gives them a little
in a bowl to share among them....</p>

<p>But the bowl is soon licked dry—and now
they are on the lookout to get whatever they
can.</p>

<p>The moment the dairyman puts aside an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
empty pail, a cat pops in like a flash, head first,
and licks it clean to the last drop; they leap
up and hang by their forepaws to the dripping
milk-sieve; they do anything and everything
to secure a taste of the delicious milk.</p>

<p>They all allow the foreman to lift them up
by the tail; they only straddle their legs....</p>

<p>“Puss, puss!” cries the good fellow affectionately
as he raises them; and adds to a
wondering onlooker, “They know I won’t hurt
them!”</p>

<p>Yes, so shamelessly did they soil themselves
with milk, that afterwards they spent hours
and hours washing each other clean and dry.</p>

<p>She felt now so utterly out of touch with
all that,—that <i>she</i> could have been a party to
such goings on! To permit herself to be
lifted up by the tail—and then, actually, to
wash another cat’s kitten!</p>

<p>She still went regularly to the farm, usually
in the early morning or the late evening. But
she never ventured out into the open yard,
and was in general very shy of showing herself.
She preferred to stand up in the hayloft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and peep through the trap-door into the
stall; but the moment she caught a glimpse of
a “human” she vanished instantly.</p>

<p>Whenever one of the farm hands came up to
fetch hay or straw for the cows and caught her
unawares, she would hiss at him. Nevertheless,
the foreman, who was fond of cats, always
put a little milk in the loft for her; it remained
invariably untouched during the day, but at
night it was drunk up.</p>

<p>“Hanged if I know what is the matter with
Grey Puss!” he often muttered to himself. “I
wonder if Box has been chasing her ... she’s
so scared; she’s more like a wild cat, the little
fool!”</p>

<p>Yes, <i>wild</i> she had been for a long time!
From the cow-stall she retreated to the loft,
where she learned to hide among the beams
and rafters. She got into the habit of climbing
trees, walking up and down thatched roofs,
and sleeping behind chimney-stacks.</p>

<p>And as time went on she became more and
more peculiar....</p>

<p>She was not like the other farm cats, who let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
their children be drowned litter after litter,
without doing anything more heroic than
miauw over their corpses. No, she allowed
<i>that</i> to happen once, after which she understood
that she had hidden her kittens badly!
Of course they could not be expected to escape
by themselves!</p>

<p>The next time she had young she hid them
deep down under a heap of straw; but the
foreman’s small boys, who always played in
the loft, heard their squealing and fished them
out—and then they were murdered. One only
was left, overlooked in the straw.</p>

<p>Most other she-cats would have been grateful
for the survivor and forgotten the rest.
But <i>she</i> did not forget; she went about seeking
and seeking, miauwing and complaining incessantly.
Finally she took the one kitten in
her mouth and carried it away to an empty
dovecote in a deserted labourer’s cottage.
Here it grew up without seeing a single “human.”
Until one fine morning it was killed
by Box....</p>

<p>Now, this spring, when she is once more to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
have kittens, she hides inside the old hollow
willow out here in the fields.</p>

<p>No living soul shall find her young <i>this</i>
time!</p>

<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_35"></a>THE BLIND SEE</b>
</h3>

<p>In addition to Big, who was striped, there
were five other kittens in the litter: a
black, a white, a grey, and a red—besides
an indescribable little production about the
size of a man’s thumb, with fur whose colouring
resembled patches of all the others put
together.</p>

<p>Tiny lay always half smothered under the
heap of kittens, and had to be content with the
worst nipple, which, although nearest the
mother’s heart, nevertheless flowed weakly.
That <a id="he"></a>he had not long ago been crushed to
death by the others must remain an insoluble
mystery!</p>

<p>The little, blind creatures were just developing
their sight. The faint, subdued light here
inside the willow stump made this trying
period unusually agreeable. Even when the
sun was shining strongly outside they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
lie staring about them without discomfort.
Each of the tiny eyes was covered with a
curious bluish film, through the damp, glazed
surface of which the slanting pupils began to
push their way. The eyes appeared extraordinarily
large in comparison with the head,
and gave the impression that the kittens were
in a state of perpetual surprise.</p>

<p>On the whole, the babies had grown. True,
their coats were not quite in order, for the fur
still stuck out patchily all over their bodies;
but the hair was there right enough, and the
colours too ... the white was as white as
day, and the black as black as night; even the
cross stripes on the grey kitten showed up
plainly.</p>

<p>Their hindquarters alone remained noticeably
undeveloped; they were still quite conical
and stunted, and jerked up stiffly and clumsily
with every movement of the body. It would
be a long time before that part attained
perfection.</p>

<p>The imps were still far from being active
and graceful! They reeled and rolled as they
crawled over the lumps of touchwood; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
could not jump at all, indeed they could
scarcely walk. It seemed as if, once having
acquired eyes, they had neglected everything
else. They used them incessantly ... and
were never tired of looking and looking!</p>

<p>They had no opportunity to gormandize.
They drank greedily, and soon sucked old
Grey Puss dry. Then she shook them off and
closed the milk-spring. This she effected by
rolling herself into a ball and pressing her
forepaws tightly to her breasts—and however
much the little ones exerted themselves to
widen the opening with their snouts so as to
get inside and continue drinking, they never
succeeded.</p>

<p>Then they had revenge by clambering up
and nestling on her back and neck; where they
lay licking their chops.</p>

<p>This sort of thing didn’t upset her in the
least. In fact, she was delighted at being
mauled about by her offspring; she stretched
herself at full length, purring and humming
the while—she knew now that they had settled
down for a while.</p>

<p>Occasionally she blinked her tight-shut eyelids,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
twisted her head round, and fastened her
keen, brassy orbs on the long row of funny
little patches of colour on her back. There
was every imaginable feline colour-scheme
there, and she studied each one separately,
noticing any peculiarity of colouring or divergence
from type....</p>

<p>Extraordinary.... It seemed to her that
she had seen all these little fellows before!</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_38"></a>THE FATHER</b>
</h3>

<p>One afternoon very early in spring a small,
snow-white he-cat came strolling carelessly
along the road. His ears were thrust forward,
betraying his interest in something ahead: he
meant to take a walk round the farm, whither
the road led ... there was a grey puss there
who attracted him!</p>

<p>He ought to have been more cautious, the
little white dwarf! A giant cat, a coloured
rival, with the demon of passion seething in
his blood and hate flaming from his eyes,
caught sight of the hare-brained fellow from
afar off and straight-way guessed his errand.</p>

<p>With rigid legs, lowered head, and loins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
held high, he comes rushing from behind ...
runs noiselessly over the soft grass at the side
of the road and overhauls the other unperceived.</p>

<p>With one spring he plants all his foreclaws
deep in the flesh of the smaller cat, who utters
a loud wail and collapses on the ground.</p>

<p>The big one maintains his grip on his defeated
foe’s shoulder, crushing him ruthlessly
in the dust. Then he presses back his torn
ears, giving an even more hateful expression to
the evil eyes, and lowering his muzzle, gloatingly
he howls his song of victory straight into
his fallen rival’s face.</p>

<p>For a good quarter of an hour he continues
to martyr his victim, who is too terrified to
move a muscle; he tears the last shred of self-respect
and honour from the coward—then
releases him and stalks before him to the farm,
without deigning to throw him another
glance. He was too despicable a rival, the
little white mongrel! The big, spotted he-cat
considered it beneath his dignity even to
thrash him.</p>

<p>But the little grey puss had other suitors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
still.... There was the squire’s ginger cat
and the bailiff’s wicked old black one; so that
both daring and cunning were necessary if
one’s courtship was to be a success. At sunset
they invaded the farm from every direction,
stealing silently through corn or kitchen
garden until they reached the garden path by
the hedge.</p>

<p>The black ruffian, who considered himself
the favourite suitor, arrived, as he imagined,
first at the rendezvous. But simultaneously
his ginger rival stuck his head through the
hedge bordering the path. At sight of each
other both halted abruptly, thrusting up their
backs and blowing out their scarred, battle-torn
cheeks.</p>

<p>For many minutes the two ugly fellows
stood glaring silently at one another....
Then their whiskers bristled, their tattered
ears disappeared, and their eyes became mere
slits in their heads; hymns of hate wailed from
their throats, and their tails writhed and
squirmed like newly-flayed eels.</p>

<p>Suddenly the big, spotted cat appears in
the garden. Tiger-like, with body almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
brushing the ground, he glides silently past
them.</p>

<p>They hate him, the low brute!... He is
their common enemy! The sight of him
caught in the act makes them allies in a flash....
They tear after him and surround him.
Then they go for him tooth and nail.</p>

<p>All thoughts of the fair one have gone from
their minds. War-cries cease; gasps and
grunts of exertion punctuate the struggle;
chests heave and ribs dilate with compressed
air; whilst naked claws are plunged into skin
and flesh. They are one to look at, one circular
mass, as they whirl round inextricably
interlocked, puffing their reeking breath into
one another’s faces.</p>

<p>The spotted devil’s powerful hind legs are
wedged in under the red cat’s body. With his
forepaws he grips him as if in a vice—and now
thrusting the needle-pointed, razor-edged horn
daggers from their sheaths, he straightens his
hind legs simultaneously to a terrible, resistless,
lacerating lunge....</p>

<p>With a stifled hiss of fury the squire’s cat
falls back. It limps moaning from the battlefield,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
with blood pouring from its stomach.</p>

<p>Now comes the old black thief’s turn!
First the hair flies ... it literally <i>steams</i> from
the two rivals as they rush at each other.
Their incredible activity is expressed in every
movement.... After lying interlocked for
some time on the ground they suddenly break
away, and, as if by witchcraft, stand on all
fours again.</p>

<p>The piebald is winning!</p>

<p>His claws comb like steel rakes. They tear
the hair from the bailiff-cat’s flanks, leaving
them bare and shining. The latter often succeeds
in parrying, and returns kick for kick,
but his hind legs lack strength, and he cannot
complete a full thrust.</p>

<p>Madness gleams in their eyes; they are beside
themselves with frenzy; fear flies from
their minds; they are exalted ... for now
they are <i>fighting</i>!</p>

<p>Until a sudden scuffle advertises that the
bailiff-cat has had enough. He tears himself
loose and bolts for his life.</p>

<p>The big piebald has won. He shakes himself
and rolls over, gives a couple of energetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
licks to his paws, and carefully brushes his
whiskers; then he hastens through the garden
up to the farmyard, where a little later he is
to be seen promenading the pigsty roof.</p>

<p>With alert expression and nervously vibrating
tail he looks inquiringly at all trap-doors
and open windows. Suddenly he gives a start;
there is Grey Puss on the manure-heap beneath
him.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation he leaps
down.... It was the decisive meeting!</p>

<p>She had always been true to this one lover....
And yet there had been times when all
the gentlemen of the neighbourhood had paid
court to her. Often she had reclined on the
planking with one in front of her, one behind,
and three or four in the elder tree above her
head.... She had been literally besieged.</p>

<p>But however many suitors might appear—even
though they came right up from the seacoast
and the fishing village—she still loved
him and him alone, the great piebald hero!</p>

<p>He was an exceptional cat: the ears, far
apart and noticeably short, were set far back
on the broad head; the neck was thick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
powerful, the body long and heavy. When
he ran, he moved with such swiftness that he
seemed to glide, and he could leap two yards
without effort.</p>

<p>He was all possible colours—black, red,
yellow, and white. A tinge of green shone
in the wicked golden eyes; they sat deep in his
head, so that his cheeks stuck out each side
like dumplings.... And in the middle of
his bristly moustache protruded a small lacerated
nose, which was always bright red and
covered with half-healed wounds. He was
always at war....</p>

<p>Once he received a deep, horrid bite just
under the throat, where he could not lick it.
So he went to his sweetheart; she helped
him....</p>

<p>She was faithful and true to him ... but
she did not trust <i>him</i> beyond the threshold.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_44"></a>THE PIEBALD DEVIL</b>
</h3>

<p>Had she reason to doubt him? He was
chock-full of lust and vice, and great in merit
as in fault; nevertheless—had she actual proof
for doubting him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>One night her eyes were opened in the most
sinister manner. The last rays of the setting
sun had departed from the fields, leaving them
wrapped in the summer evening’s mist and
obscurity. Only some horses greeted the solitary
nocturnal marauder with warm, friendly
neighing.</p>

<p>They knew him well, although he was only
a cat, whose many-coloured body seemed grey,
like all other cats, in the twilight. In doorway,
at the pump, in yard, and in stable he was
their daily companion. How nice to see him
here on the meadow too! “Ehehehe,” they
neighed ... welcome to the tethering-ground!</p>

<p>He ignored them completely, neither breaking
his stride, nor wagging his tail, nor giving
a single miauw. Past nuisances like foals
which greeted him boisterously he went unresponsive
and bored. He was out hunting
now—nothing else mattered!</p>

<p>With gliding step he passes from clover
field to seed ground, jumping with noiseless,
tense spring over brook and ditch. His progress
roused the lark from heavy slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>He reaches a copse—and soon afterward is
heard the death-shriek of a captured blackbird.
With covetous grasp he seizes his victim,
buries his sharp teeth in its breast, and
sucks with long sniffs the warm, odorous bird-smell....</p>

<p>It was not hunger which drove him to the
crime: he has just made a full meal off a
couple of fat mice. But when coming unexpectedly
upon the bird in the copse, he could
not control his murderous impulse.</p>

<p>He sits with the booty in his jaws, purring
contentedly, and ponders frowningly where he
shall conceal his capture.</p>

<p>The summer moon shines big and round
from the pale blue, starless sky—and white,
pink-underlined layers of cloud hover like
feathers far out on the horizon. Warm puffs
of wind come and go, enveloping him in the
meadow’s silver mist, making the dim shelter
of the hedge seem hot and oppressive.</p>

<p>His eyes fall on the three ancient willow
stumps at the far end of the field! He, too,
knows how rotten and hollow they are, and
how well adapted for a hiding-place. True,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
it is rather a long way there ... through the
soaking wet rye—but that can’t be helped!</p>

<p>The night is absolutely silent, broken only
by the rasping song of the little reed-warbler
from a swampy hole among the rye. The
din of the farm has long since died down; not
even the bark of a dog is heard, and neither
water-pump nor wind-motor can summon up
another note. How splendid to have ears, to
be able to listen! Now he hears only the play
of the grasshoppers, the love-song of the cock-chafer,
and the high-pitched music of the ant-hills.</p>

<p>Here, behind a knotted root at the base of
the largest of the old willow trees, he conceals
the blackbird, afterwards covering it carefully
with earth and moss. Then he reaches his
forepaws up to the trunk to stretch his limbs
and sharpen his claws.</p>

<p>He gives a violent start! The scarred, rugged
skin on his head wrinkles thoughtfully, as
it always does when something attracts his attention.
His multicoloured tail jerks uneasily,
as he peers about him with uplifted
ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>The subdued rustling and squeaking noises
from inside the tree trunk continue....</p>

<p>Now there is no longer room for doubt....</p>

<p>With a giant leap he springs up the tree,
and next moment he is down in the bole.</p>

<p>Grey Puss is not at home....</p>

<p>The little kittens swarm up to him. Tiny
seeks to drink, while Black and Big make a
joyful assault on his swiftly wagging tail.
He lowers his nose to each of the little fellows
in turn as if tasting their smell. Then, as if
suddenly gone mad, he begins clawing about
in all directions at the defenceless kittens.
Mewing and squealing, they roll away to all
sides like lumps of earth—but the he-cat’s
frenzy increases.</p>

<p>He seizes Tiny by the mouth, fixes an eyetooth
in his scruff and hurtles out of the willow
with him. The little tot hangs limp and
apparently lifeless in the jaw of his brutal
sire; but, fortunately for him, the old cat is
not hungry, and so is content with burying the
kitten at the foot of the willow, by the side of
the dead blackbird.</p>

<p>In justice to the criminal it must be stated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
that he has no conception of the enormity of
his crime; only when he is on his way up the
willow for the second time is he enlightened—and
that in a most ruthless manner. Two
rows of gimlet-pointed claws descend from
nowhere and almost nail him to the bark....
Furious, he turns his visage ... and the
next second all his old half-healed wounds are
torn open again!</p>

<p>Grey Puss has surprised him—and recognizes
him instantly. So it is <i>he</i> who comes
wrecking her maternal happiness; yes, she
thought as much! And like a vice she clings
to his back, biting and scratching and tearing
as he flees panic-stricken along the hedge.</p>

<p>Away, away, home, anywhere!</p>

<p>He is more afraid of Grey Puss’ mother-claws
than of the raven’s beak or the blade of
the reaping-machine; he has learnt to his cost
that a she-cat knows not the word mercy when
her swollen udders are carrying milk for her
young.</p>

<p>He lacked a conscience, this big, piebald
he-cat—and he respected nothing except his
own skin! The egg of the lark, the chick of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the partridge, the young of the hare, were
each and all grist to his mill; he took everything
he could find, catch, or steal.</p>

<p>On the rafter at home in the farmyard,
where Grey Puss used to lie, he had been
allowed free passage, until the very moment
when some small bundles lay shivering on the
hay in the corner. Then the fascination of
his black face and shining coat seemed to vanish;
she would not allow him to approach; he
was not even admitted to the barn. If he
just showed himself at the trap-door she
would become seized with frenzy, spring up,
and fly at him as if he were a dog! He had
always to beat a hurried retreat!</p>

<p>Did she read his character; did she know
that the feeling of paternal love was foreign
to his nature? In any case, she took no risks;
she never trusted him over the threshold....</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_50"></a>THE RESCUE OF TINY</b>
</h3>

<p>Grey Puss’ milk tasted sour for a whole day
following the adventure; she was frightfully
restless and upset. Several of the young ones
had wounds and had to be licked. Time after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
time she ran her glance over the small, rolled-up
patches of colour; greedily her eyes devoured
each little furry coat; but it was with
no trace of the sweetness of recollection or the
joy of recognition.</p>

<p>Were they all there ... all? Their villain
of a father she had already forgotten; not
until she was giving suck did she become suddenly
nervous. She felt that one of the
swollen udders remained swollen, and now she
nuzzled with her nose along the row. Big,
Red, White, Grey ... yes, she found them
all! But where was the little piebald
one?...</p>

<p>The kittens buried their noses deep in her
fur to get a good hold of the small, sprouting
milk-springs. All was quiet inside the willow
trunk; only now and again was heard the
sucking of the eager little lips....</p>

<p>Yes, to be sure, she missed a colour ...
missed just that one which—in spite of all—she
unconsciously preferred to all the rest;
that seemed made up of bits of colour from all
the other colours.... Then suddenly a thin,
feeble crying reached her ever-listening ears.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
It seemed to her to come from under the willow
bole. Perhaps there was a crevice in the
nursery?</p>

<p>Cautiously getting up, she begins to scratch
a little with her forepaws in the floor; but
finds no hole.</p>

<p>She dismisses the thought that one of the
young ones is really missing, and lies down
again and resumes her maternal duties. For
a time all is peace, and she abandons herself
completely to the pleasure of being at the
mercy of her kitten flock, but again comes the
faint cry for help. This time it is so heart-rending
that she springs up, and then, half
crouching, listens breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Mew, mew!” it tinkles to her from the
distant depths. And now she begins to answer
in anxious, encouraging tones, meanwhile
pushing her snout among the young ones to
count them. The tinkling from below upsets
and worries her; but presently she stifles
her anxiety by rolling right under the heap of
kittens and congratulating herself that she has
so many dear children safe and sound.</p>

<p>Meanwhile from his living tomb by the side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
of the dead blackbird, Tiny continues foghornlike,
to emit at regular intervals his
ceaseless signals for assistance. He has lain
for a long time buried alive; but, accustomed
as he is to having his brothers and sisters on
top of him, the thin layer of moss and earth
over him does not embarrass him particularly.
Now he has recovered so much that he can not
only squeal but wriggle also—a fact which
serves to increase the air supply in his lungs,
so that his weak cries gain momentarily in
strength and resonance.</p>

<p>Suddenly the heap of earth is swept from
him, and he hears his mother’s soft voice right
in his ear. Oh, what a stream of happiness
flows through him! He stretches his tiny
body towards the strong, comforting miauw,
and like a freezing man making for the fire, he
puts his wet, earth-cold head against the
mother-cat’s soft neck and feels her warm
breath ripple over him.</p>

<p>Grey Puss’ eyes shine green and evil; they
speak plainly of surprise and emotion. She
begins purring angrily, so that the young ones
inside the tree lift their ears anxiously and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
wonder, “What’s happening down there at
the foot of the tree?”</p>

<p>Tiny’s wound is licked, and the mother prepares
to return. He must be carried, of <a id="comma"></a>course, ...
and the problem is to find a hold which
will not destroy the creature. She tries to
grasp him by the scruff, but here he is so sore
that time after time the attempt fails. Cautiously
she presses her teeth into his back and
shoulder; but cannot find a hold, although he
seeks instinctively to help her by stiffening his
body as she lifts.</p>

<p>However, it <i>must</i> be done somehow; there
is not the slightest doubt that he is to be carried
up! So she opens her mouth wide and
puts her jaws round his neck. Then, disregarding
his lively protests, she cautiously
closes her mouth.</p>

<p>He becomes suddenly quite quiet. She
needs all her presence of mind to judge how
tightly she may grip him without making it
his last journey.</p>

<p>He hangs there in his mother’s jaws and
closes his earth-clogged eyes, clutching her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
body tightly with his little legs. But he surrenders
himself to her without complaint and
without movement, bearing the pain in blind
faith in her omnipotence.</p>

<p>In two jumps she reaches the top, slides
down into the bole, and a moment later deposits
him carefully on the ground among the
others. A healing warmth envelops him—and,
as the kittens are already satisfied, he
secures an unusually large share of milk.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_55"></a>THE FLIGHT FROM THE WILLOW</b>
</h3>

<p>Truly that morning the kittens had trembled
in the shadow of death!</p>

<p>And Grey Puss always regarded the he-cat
as the first betrayer, the cause of all her
subsequent sorrows and misfortunes.</p>

<p>Only a week later a farm hand saw her as
she sneaked into the willow. Putting his ear
against the trunk, he heard the kittens stirring,
and so, hanging his hat and coat on a branch,
he ran home to the farm to fetch the dog....</p>

<p>Box was not to be found; and not till the
midday meal did he get hold of him—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
when at last the fellow returned to stamp out
the “vermin,” the trunk was deserted and
empty.</p>

<p>He explored the neighbouring fields. The
dog found the scent at once and gave tongue—then
deep among the corn was fought a
terrific battle. The dog’s barks turned to
howls, and soon afterwards Box returned as
if shot from a cannon, with his tail-stump
curled between his legs.</p>

</div>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_57"></a>THE BURIAL-MOUND</b>
</h3>

<p>She came to a mound which rose, peaceful
and untrodden, in the middle of the
field. On every side of it corn was
growing, but the mound itself was green with
grass and smothered in wild flowers: sorrel
and heather grew side by side with the bright
yellow calyx of the dandelion. A border of
blackthorn wreathed the base of the mound,
and a pair of great moss-covered boulders
crowned the top.</p>

<p>Grey Puss sat down on one of the stones
and stared out disconsolately over the landscape,
whose colours were just retiring for
their nightly rest.</p>

<p>Half unconsciously, she began to scratch
among some tufts of grass and dried leaves
which covered a depression in the turf; they
came away very easily. She noticed how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
quickly she delved deeper and deeper down.</p>

<p>She became thoroughly interested....</p>

<p>She had happened upon an old, thinly-covered
fox-hole, and when at last she had
cleared the entrance, a narrow spiral passage
lay open before her. She was accustomed to
darkness; and happy at the possibility of finding
a new home for her kittens, she bravely
entered the opening.</p>

<p>After a short distance the tunnel made an
abrupt turn, continued downwards in a curve
over some enormous boulders—and then
plunged straight into the vault.</p>

<p>Huge boulders with half-hewn surfaces
stood as if growing from the ground. Above
them were others of a similar kind, the walls
continuing in an unbroken curve until they
met at the top, thus forming the solid vaulted
roof of the sepulchre. In the splits were
wedged smaller stones, the whole making a
small square chamber.</p>

<p>Had body-snatchers at some time desecrated
this grave? Or perhaps some lawful visitor
on his departure centuries before had neglected
to close it properly behind him! In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
either case one of the corner stones was displaced;
so much so that a fox had continued
his burrow right into the very burial-chamber.</p>

<p>A gruesome place of death even for a cat to
happen upon!</p>

<p>A weird, vicious, humming noise greeted
her the moment she thrust in her nose ... a
fluttering of something that was, and yet was
not, surrounded her and filled her ears, nose,
and mouth, making her cough and spit.</p>

<p>Had she been a human being she would
have been horrified, and imagined it to be the
ghost of the dead sounding her doom for
disturbing its peace; but she was only a cat,
and knew nothing of the beyond.</p>

<p>As she jumped down into the vault, and in
so doing brushed the wall with her tail, the
din about her head reached its climax: hundreds
of mosquitoes and bats inhabiting the
grave protested vigorously against her entrance.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment undecided, taking
stock of her surroundings....</p>

<p>The floor was firm, and as hard and uneven
as a threshing-floor. A hollow echo vibrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
through the air at her every movement, the
hissing of her breath or the grating of her
claws.</p>

<p>Just before the sun went down, a thin ray of
light filtered through a crevice in the stones
opposite the tunnel. Thousands of tiny
points of light, the watchful eyes of the denizens
of the tomb, leaped into being.</p>

<p>Otherwise the shadows prevailed, and were
only conquered little by little by her piercing
glance. Later she distinguished fragments of
bones and skulls on the ground, and saw
supine toads fumbling their way along the
walls.</p>

<p>In some inexplicable manner a heap of elm
leaves had found their way into one of the
corners; they crackled and shrieked “Halt!”
when she trod on them, but promised, nevertheless,
a warm and dry couch.</p>

<p>The conditions were acceptable—besides,
there was no alternative! As soon, therefore,
as she had remained there long enough to feel
at ease, she made her decision.</p>

<p>Here in the old viking’s tomb she made her
home. On the leaves and fragments of straw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
she dropped her kittens, fetching them one by
one from their various hiding-places in furrows
and behind stones, where she had been
forced to harbour them in her headlong flight
from the old willow stump.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_61"></a>LIFE IN THE BURIAL-MOUND</b>
</h3>

<p>The fugitive little mother-cat had brought
her kittens under cover just in time. That
night a storm broke loose and thunder crashed
incessantly, accompanying heavy showers of
rain. Warm, heavy drops streamed down in
bucketfuls; the earth drank until the crevices
in its broken crust were filled to overflowing,
while a slimy, bottomless fluid filled all holes
in the roads.</p>

<p>But not a drop found its way down to this
century-old sepulchre—the resting-place was
too well built for that!</p>

<p>Towards morning the tempest died down.
The June sun slowly swept the warm, bluish
haze from the landscape, and poured its white
shining beams over the fertile green cornfields.
Strong, delicious odours, held in
bondage by the mist, are suddenly released,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and float through the air in small, scented
clouds.</p>

<p>It was too wet for a cat to venture out;
better wait a little and let the sun dry things a
bit!</p>

<p>In the farthest corner, where the darkness
is deepest, Grey Puss is sitting. She relaxes
her muscular body completely on the leafy
couch, and stretches her forepaws lazily in
front of her. The entire kitten flock is lying
in her lap.</p>

<p>Since daybreak she has had such a nice
quiet time; the others have all been sleeping
soundly, tumbled in a heap. But now peace
is at an end; the dear children are all awake,
and almost killing her in their exuberant joy.</p>

<p>Not even Tiny spares her, but seizes the
opportunity of pursuing the exhausted milk-springs.
Lying on his back, and using his
hind legs as levers, he toboggans in short slides
from one nipple to another. It couldn’t be
true that there was not a drop left!</p>

<p>From the playful horde arise hissing and
spitting, punctuated by occasional dull bumps
as they miss their footing and tumble on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
floor. All at once Grey Puss gets up from
her corner, walks out into the middle, and
throws herself down in the thin streak of light
which fumbles its way through the roof.
Look out—now she is going to play their favourite
game; now they are in for a treat!
They shall play “catch mouse” with the tip of
her tail.</p>

<p>Comfortably stretched on her back with all
four legs wide apart, she lies perfectly still,
not moving a limb, not a hair. Presently the
end-most tip of her tail begins very, very
slowly to wriggle to and fro; then it falls with
a firm little thump on the floor.</p>

<p>It is the signal for the game to begin!</p>

<p>Immediately the tiny, living colours surround
the tail. And in turn, usually two at
a time, they make their attempts.</p>

<p>The supple tail-end writhes and squirms at
lightning speed over the floor, the kittens’ eyes
following its twists and bends in fascinated
silence. Suddenly it disappears from sight;
there is a breathless pause ... then the furry
tip slowly emerges from under the heap of
leaves. They strike at it with their paws,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
rush at it, catch hold of it, and—if it unfortunately
escapes—rush upon it again. They
bite it, clutch it, shake it.... At last they
have secured a firm grip. The tables are
suddenly turned! Now it is the tail which
grips and shakes and rocks <i>them</i> to and fro in
the air; they are fighting with a real, live,
reckless enemy of equal strength, and are permitted
to experience the joy of victory.</p>

<p>No spitting or growling is heard; all takes
place in dead silence—only the smacks of the
tail and the bumps of the paws betray the
presence of living beings. They are like
shadows tumbling about....</p>

<p>The game goes on in half-hour spells—until
exhaustion overtakes first one, then another,
and sleep again sweeps them together into a
lifeless heap.</p>

<p>Now Grey Puss gets up and makes for the
entrance—it is her turn to play “catch mouse.”</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_64"></a>THE FIRST MOUSE</b>
</h3>

<p>Several weeks pass happily....</p>

<p>The corn round the burial-mound ripens,
and all sorts of grasses compete to lengthen its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
luxuriant green covering. The stones on the
top become more and more hidden from the
field-path below.</p>

<p>The lark comes and trills at sunrise and
midday; and in the evening the whinchat
twitters its mournful song. The little, low
grass mound has not yet betrayed its
secret....</p>

<p>The kittens in its bowels are now about
twice the size of moles; their bodies have
become a trifle longer and more elastic, and on
their short, plump hindquarters the worm-like
appendages of childhood are beginning
to thicken into soft, furry tails. Their eyes
shine like stars, and on each of the small,
bullet-shaped heads a little wrinkled snout
forms a centre for a bunch of stiff, shiny
whiskers. It is about time, the old cat thinks,
that they begin to take solid food.</p>

<p>At first she brings them eggs and unfledged
birds, which their baby jaws soon learn to masticate.
Later on their diet becomes coarser
and more varied.</p>

<p>Early one morning she appears with a
small, greyish-brown creature in her jaws, its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
white stomach shining like a puddle of water
reflecting the sun. Its short, little forepaws
with the pink claws hang limp in surrender,
and its long hind legs stick out stiffly like stilts.
A thin, hairless tail dangling like a broken
straw completes the picture.</p>

<p>The kittens at once respond to their
mother’s food-signal, and, falling over one
another in their eagerness, rush headlong to
the entrance.</p>

<p>With their small behinds stiffly elevated,
they rub themselves affectionately against the
old cat’s legs and body; she positively disappears
in a forest of tails. Purring loudly, her
head erect, she remains standing before them,
turning and twisting the interesting creature
to give them a full view of the spoil.</p>

<p>At last, after what seems an endless wait,
each receives his mouthful.</p>

<p>Big crouches on his haunches and plays delightedly
with the mouse’s tail, which he
holds in his paws. When, at a smack from
him, it gives a jump, his eyes glow and he
hops round his new toy on his hind legs.
Suddenly he runs away to a corner and begins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
digging a hole—Grey Puss sees that he has
his father’s appetite!</p>

<p>The first few times she herself kills the
mouse with a bite, but later on the young ones
are permitted to share in the fun. Soon also
she allows them to play a little with the unfortunates,
so that they may learn the first
principles in the art of trapping. To encourage
them still further to forage for themselves,
she buries her victims round about the
base of the burial-mound.</p>

<p>The struggle for food has left its mark upon
the little mother-cat. She has become noticeably
thinner, and her coat no longer has its
glossy sheen. The crowd of rapidly growing
children, who make constantly increasing demands
on her skill, is telling on her strength.
It is almost impossible for her to secure all the
mice necessary for them—and therefore, in
her dilemma, she sometimes leaves the
straight path of virtue and does what second
nature urges her.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_67"></a>THE THIEF</b>
</h3>

<p>One day about noon she is skirmishing in
the neighbourhood of the farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>She lies hidden in the grass, her head in the
air, keeping sharp look out for booty. In
each of the pancake-coloured orbs lies a vivid
coal-black streak which divides the pancake
into two halves. Cunning and deceit stream
from her eyes.</p>

<p>Behind the garden hedge bordering the
loose, dry, potato-planted earth a farm hen
clucks her thirteen chicks together. The hen
has just finished an exhaustive scratching of
the soil—and now is taking a simultaneous sun
and sand bath, lying luxuriously with widespread
wings, her plump, featherless belly
fully exposed. The hen is asleep—her head,
with its anæmic comb, sticks up stiffly in the
air. Her eyes are fast shut.</p>

<p>The wind carries to Grey Puss fragments
of dear, home-like sounds; but they do not,
as in former times, soothe her nerves. On the
contrary, they rouse and excite her with the
promise of food. She creeps nearer and
nearer in short bursts towards the sleeping
hen. Each time she stops to listen—but hears
only the chicks enjoying life: her blood races.</p>

<p>Is it tame, that one sitting there? She has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
forgotten; she no longer distinguishes between
tame and wild! She distinguishes only between
what is good, and what is not good, for
her children to eat.</p>

<p>The soft, pregnant signs of June meet her
eyes on every side. Between fresh green oatfields
and succulent clover-carpets the rye
whitens and blackens. There along the hedge
by the old willows the line of cattle stretches;
and down in the meadow, where calves and
foals play in their pens, the long-nosed stork
walks sunning himself.</p>

<p>The heavy-laden milk-cart drags itself
through the stifling noon homeward to the
farm. In front of it two red-cheeked, heavy-bosomed
girls are seated; an old cow follows
tottering behind.</p>

<p>Grey Puss’ opportunity has come—she
makes a lightning spring forward....</p>

<p>With a resounding “cluck” the hen jumps
up, puffs out her feathers and spreads wide
her wings. Her anxious cry of alarm rings
over the potato-field, whither she rushes feverishly
to collect and protect her children.
Grey Puss with a plump young cock in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
jaws disappears with a mighty spring among
the rye.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later she emerges from
the hawthorn clump at the base of the burial-mound.
The swallows are making their
sweeping curves round about the top, veering
and shrieking incessantly—there must be
something up there to attract their attention!</p>

<p>The furry inhabitants of the mound, who
have been lying in a group sunning themselves,
see the old cat approach, dragging the great
chicken after her; she holds it by the neck, its
body and long, naked legs hanging limp and
pitiful to either side.</p>

<p>Big, the glutton, at once seizes hold of a
wing, and, with closed eyes, grinds and tears
the soft-stemmed feathers, making a great
deal of noise about it.</p>

<p>Big’s assault causes the chicken to swing towards
him; at this, Black begins to feel nervous
about his share of the spoil—with a jump
he runs forward and hangs tightly to one of
the legs.</p>

<p>With flattened ears and wide-stretched
paws Black tugs with all his might. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
neck is stretched forward and the front part
of his body raised, but his stomach and hind
legs drag along the ground. He resists strenuously
and takes a firm hold—he will take
care that Big doesn’t steal all the spoil; or if
he does, then he must pull <i>him</i> along too!</p>

<p>Grey Puss has let go her hold of the neck
and now stands with the chicken’s head in her
mouth; she also will make certain of something—and
she likes the head best of all.</p>

<p>Now the remaining kittens come forward.
Grey buries her little black muzzle in the
chicken’s body-feathers. Following her custom,
she goes very cautiously to work, and
sniffs for a long time before taking hold. But
Red, who is more impetuous, digs away with
her foreclaws, trying to make a hole as quickly
as possible; and, having at last succeeded, she—eagerly
assisted by White and Tiny—pulls
out endless lengths of warm intestines.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_71"></a>DROWN THE BRUTE</b>
</h3>

<p>Chicken after chicken kept vanishing from
the farmyard ... mysteriously ... without
trace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>The farmer’s precious racing-pigeons also
disappeared, stolen, one by one, in broad daylight.
Some of their feathers were found by
the fence—it was there that Grey Puss lay in
ambush, and fell upon the birds before they
had time to rise in the air.</p>

<p>They kept watch for her early and late—and
the farmer often did sentry duty half the
day with loaded gun; he would settle her, sure
enough....</p>

<p>But she was cunning and cautious—and the
hours of vigil too long for the farmer! So
they decided to set a trap.</p>

<p>She walked straight into it! That was not
surprising, for she was completely without
experience of traps.</p>

<p>There she was; at last they had the criminal!</p>

<p>“The grey she-cat! Yes, I thought as
much!” shouted the farmer, swearing....
Yes, he remembered that gourmand well!</p>

<p>It was she who ate only the heads of rats.
And once, two years ago, she had been found
with a chicken in her jaws. She would have
been shot there and then, had not the foreman
sworn that the chicken was dead before she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
found it. Well, now at last they knew the
truth—the beast must be drowned!</p>

<p>Grey Puss suspected no evil when she was
taken to the scullery, which she knew so well,
and released from the trap. Furthermore,
thirsty and ravenous as she was, she accepted
their hospitality in the form of a large bowl
of milk.... They thought she should have
something in reserve for her long journey.</p>

<p>She sat down, cat-like, with her tail curled
round her behind, and in a moment of weakness
allowed her former friend, the foreman,
to stroke her back.</p>

<p>Just as she was finishing and was contentedly
licking her mouth, stiff, horny fingers grabbed
her and picked her up as if she had been a
kitten. Other fingers opened a black abyss
beneath her—and, with Box yelling and leaping
round her, she was thrust quickly into a
sack.</p>

<p>For the first time she began to suspect something
wrong. She struggled violently and
clutched with her claws—but down she went
nevertheless.</p>

<p>She scratches madly at the sack.... Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
twenty crescent-shaped claws stick out through
the canvas in white clusters. However much
they shake she won’t go to the bottom, but
remains obstinately clinging half-way up the
side. It dawns suddenly upon her that the
humans have deceived her by their unusual
kindness; now at last is confirmed what she
has so often suspected, that humans, when they
try, can be even more cunning than she.</p>

<p>All is pitch-black around her.... Her
pupils contract, and her sight, which has always
served her so well, now works a veritable
miracle: she sees right through the canvas,
sees clearly the gleam of water appear
beneath her.</p>

<p>When they swing her to and fro, in just the
same way as the wind has so often swung her
in the treetop, it becomes more difficult to
see; everything grows dark again.</p>

<p>Suddenly she is falling ... yes, she feels
at once that she is falling! She clings even
more frantically to the side of the sack.</p>

<p>But the sack is falling too! She withdraws
her claws from the canvas and holds out her
paws ready to land, just as she used to do in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the old days when she was kicked through
the trap-door in the loft. Suddenly she feels
something hard and cold touch her.... She
is not alone in the sack—she has a comrade!</p>

<p>The comrade is a brick....</p>

<p>The next moment she reaches the water!
An ice-cold shower streams in on her, with
a smell so horrible that she quite forgets to
shiver. She is on the point of suffocation,
and leaps up and down the sides of the sack
like a fly in a bottle....</p>

<p>The sack is a new one. It has been sacrificed
specially for her; they don’t want to
see <i>her</i> again! But just as the canvas has
hitherto defied her claws, so, to a certain
degree, it defies the water; she still finds a
little air to <a id="breathe"></a>breathe, in her mad death-dance
in the dark....</p>

<p>All the time she tears at the sack.... She
is lucky, and makes an opening in the seam.
She struggles through, comes to the surface,
sucks in air, sees land, and paddles hurriedly
to the bank.</p>

<p>The farm hand who was sent to drown Grey
Puss obeyed the order much against his will.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
He had been a sailor in his younger days, and
knew what a lingering torture death by
drowning was.</p>

<p>Why were land-crabs always so keen on
this way of ending life? Because mankind
had a natural tendency towards cowardice
and laziness, he supposed. To smash a cat’s
skull or put a bullet through a dog’s brain
demands an effort—besides, it was unpleasant
to see the expression in the victim’s eyes! No,
it was so much easier to drown the thing....</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if this isn’t the last time!”
said the man shamefacedly, as he watched the
sack disappear from sight; and immediately
swung round on his heel and walked away.</p>

<p>So that no one saw the little head which
pushed its way breathlessly through the green
duck-weed; nor the thin, bedraggled body
which a few moments later stood shaking
itself dry among the weeds.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_76"></a>A GREAT RECEPTION</b>
</h3>

<p>Grey Puss went straight home to her
kittens, and that by the main road.</p>

<p>No sneaking along the ditches or crawling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
through the furrows, as so often before when
dragging her spoil. No, to-day she came
empty-handed, alas! besides being battered
and breathless. She ran with all her might!</p>

<p>A great reception awaited her.</p>

<p>A whole long night and the half of a day
she had been away—what a relief when she
appears; thank goodness she has come back
at last!</p>

<p>Big, the strong man of the litter, rushes
ecstatically to meet her, and flings both paws
round her neck, dragging her tired, wet head
from side to side until he nearly kills her
with joy. The other kittens run straight to
her udders, each trying to drink the most milk
in the shortest time.</p>

<p>Quite bewildered, but without further
thought of her experience, Grey Puss sits
down and gathers the little kittens in her
arms, while Big, filled with holy zeal, begins
licking her wet black and damp, bedraggled
coat with his tongue.</p>

<p>It is true that as a rule a cat washes her
kitten, but with Grey Puss things are reversed:
Big makes his mother’s toilet daily—and is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
moreover, so generous with his tongue that
he washes all the kittens too.</p>

<p>And now on this occasion, when his kind
mamma—besides arriving depressed and without
her customary miauw-signal—has come
home soaking wet, the son’s energy knows no
bounds.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, although going over her
twice, he finishes washing his mother before
the children have completed their drinking
operations; and so is compelled to find another
outlet for his exuberance. He rushes round
and round the room at full speed....</p>

<p>The fact of the whole family being in his
path does not deter him in the least. He
jumps recklessly into their midst, and “takes
off” again with a long jump from his mother’s
forehead.</p>

<p>Later, upon making the discovery that two
of the little ones have become separated from
the rest, he thinks at once of something new:
he plays “catch mouse” with them....</p>

<p>In a flash he has captured Black under one
paw and White under the other, and holds
them pressed down ruthlessly to the ground.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Black spits and bites recklessly at his captor,
but the good-natured little White only cries
miserably. A moment later Big gets a good
box on the ears from the old cat’s paw.</p>

<p>He was so very robust—just like his father!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After that day Grey Puss never dared venture
into the farmyard, not even by night; she
considered herself banished once for all....</p>

<p>She became a total outcast, spitting and
swearing at man’s approach. “Fiew!” she
would hiss, crouching back, as if pulled from
behind; and then turn and vanish in a flash.</p>

<p>She forgot her happy days of kittenhood
and went back to nature and independence,
her claws turned against every living being.</p>

<p>It was not an easy path she had chosen.
The work of catching and killing at times
entailed almost insuperable difficulties.</p>

<p>After all, what wild-beast attributes were
needed to capture a little half-tame mouse or
pigeon in a barn; to sneak in and lick up
milk from the stall; to dig out bloater-heads
from the manure-heap? No, <i>now</i> she had to
begin all over again and practise the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
elementary things: to creep noiselessly forward,
make her spring, and disappear like
lightning.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She adopted the method the retriever employs
to carry small birds, and applied it to
mice. As soon as the rodents were caught
and killed, she arranged them in a row on the
ground; and then packed them side by side in
her mouth, so that only the heads and tails
hung out.</p>

<p>One morning she took a hare home to the
young ones, and, a few days later, a full-grown
weasel—tangible proofs that she had
learnt now to overpower and kill the most refractory
opponents.</p>

<p>After a short time she learned even to bring
down the swallow as it swept with dazzling
speed over the earth.</p>

<b><a id="newlink_81"></a>THE TRICKSTER</b>
</h3>

<p>On the top of the mound the kittens are
playing, in and out among the old
tombstones.</p>

<p>The sun has risen. It shines in long,
golden stripes on the stones and lights up the
deep, gloomy sepulchre; pools of water
glisten, and fields and meadows are already
green-white with light.</p>

<p>Big sits on his haunches with a clover stem
in his claws. He looks as if he is studying the
flower, while at the same time he nips off the
leaves one by one with his sharp little teeth.
The others watch him, gaping with astonishment.</p>

<p>Suddenly he throws the stalk away and
leaps over the heads of the others.... One
of the granite stones at that moment reflects
the sun and attracts his attention; he can
never look at a stone without at once making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
a dash to reach the other side of it and hide.
His disappearance is so provoking that a
couple of the others cannot resist jumping up
and joining in the game.</p>

<p>They gallop after him, and now they play
hide-and-seek round the stones, until Big
takes advantage of his long start and climbs
into an old empty pail in an adjacent thicket.
His playmates run about all over the place
looking for him....</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the jester’s white socks
peep over the edge of the pail; a pair of
yellow-grey ear-tips follow—and now springs
into sight a happy, laughing cat-face!</p>

<p>Black’s claws begin to itch; he wants very
much to play, but in his own manner. He
has been up to the clover stem and smelt it
carefully; he has also taken it between his
paws, but thrown it away contemptuously. A
plant stem, a mere flower, seems to him quite
useless; a thistle, on the contrary, which
pricks his nose when he smells it is much more
exciting. He can at any rate get angry with
it.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sees Red and Big engaged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
an angry wrestling match, while White and
Grey stalk them from opposite sides.</p>

<p>With a spring he is upon them; flings himself
first upon White, turns her head over
heels, and then falls upon Grey. In a furry,
fighting ball they roll over and over down the
hill....</p>

<p>Grey gets on top, and Black suddenly
realizes that he is getting the worst of things.
He at once brings his hind legs into play and
claws his adversary’s stomach and nose mercilessly—in
real earnest with naked claws!</p>

<p>Grey wails miserably, and at the sound the
whole flock comes rushing forward with
joyous recklessness. But Black does not wait
for the assault; with doubled-up body and
curved tail, he stalks sideways towards them.
They expect him to jump, but instead he sticks
his claws right into their eyes.</p>

<p>But the battle is too unequal; Black has to
retreat hurriedly. He flees to the top of a
small aspen, creeps out along one of its upper
branches, and from there jumps into the hawthorn
thicket encircling the base of the hill.
He does not stop even there, but continues his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
flight through the thicket all the way round
the hill. Every thorn that pricks him teases
him and fills him with delight. He crawls
from branch to branch like a great black
caterpillar, while the others, who have long
since forgotten all about him, go on with
their game.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The rays of the morning sun sweep gleaming
over the fields; the barley shines like spun
silk, the oats like molten silver, while lake
and pond and pit lie like mirrors. The buzzing
of flies and the humming of bees rise
incessantly into the hot, motionless air; above
the burial mound the gnats dance in a swarm.
The air is filled with sounds: the sweet trilling
of the larks; the snorting of the harnessed
horse from the road; the bleating of calves
and the rattling of pails from the distant
farm....</p>

<p>A halt has been called in the game; the
tired kittens are resting.... Grey and
Red, who had got the worst knocks, sulk together
with their tails encircling their little
round behinds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Then Big Puss gets up.... The others
half raise their sleepy eyelids; what on earth
is he going to do now?</p>

<p>With the side of his paw he begins softly
patting a little lump on the ground; the loose
mould slides forward and the bump collapses.</p>

<p>At this he goes suddenly mad with excitement.
Holding his forepaws stiffly in front
of him, he leaps forward, like a monkey on a
stick, in a series of jumps, at each plunge
pushing up a little mouse-grey cushion of
sand, which he simultaneously flings behind
him with the backward sweep of his paws.</p>

<p>His brothers and sisters are now thoroughly
roused; their eyes, which but a short time
before were dull and bored, shine eagerly,
their curled-up backs straighten out, and their
paws are held stick-like in front of them,
ready for the new, fascinating game.</p>

<p>He really is an Edison-cat, is Big Puss!
There they had all been sitting bored to death,
and now ... now he comes and makes grey
mice spring up out of the ground and then
disappear again! They must try the new
game at once....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>The next moment the six little splashes of
colour are again rushing round like mad....
Even Black has jumped down from his
branch to the ground, where he is soon busily
engaged in crouching and leaping, creating
and destroying the new little, maddening,
earth-born mice. A splendid game for little
pussy-cats!</p>

<p>The midday sun pours its hot breath down
upon the earth; the air quivers out there
above the fields as if boiling. The sand and
stones are burning hot....</p>

<p>But the grass shines smilingly back at the
sun, and the rye bursts into flower.</p>

<p>The kittens lift their heads as they hear a
rustling in the corn: along the secret path
which has gradually formed itself, Grey
Puss returns home with her catch.</p>

<p>Not chicken for dinner to-day, but—herring!
The fishmonger’s cart upset last night
at the turn of the road, and dropped a box of
splendid fresh herrings. Grey Puss, who had
stuffed herself to bursting-point on the spot
and dug down half a score besides, appears
now with a couple hanging out of her mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>At first this new kind of food is greeted with
contempt; it is cold and slimy—and doesn’t
smell! But when the mother starts munching,
the young ones soon follow her example, and
join in the feast.</p>

<p>Delicious food! After the first taste each
of them grabs a big lump; even Tiny, who
has never taken kindly to solid diet, displays
unusual eagerness. He devours not only his
own share, but in addition, is foolhardy
enough to covet some of Black’s.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time in his sheltered life,
the little kitten sees the furious, grinning face,
and the flattened, pressed-back ears, of an
angry cat. And when, in spite of these, he
continues innocently to reach in under the
head, and is even lucky enough to pull out a
piece of herring, down flashes a vicious forepaw,
and he feels the scratch of a sharp,
curved claw upon his tender nose.</p>

<p>Tears of pain spring to his eyes as he recoils,
<a id="mewing"></a>mewing piteously; while Black resumes
his meal, emitting at intervals weird, muffled
noises like threatening thunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_88"></a>THE LID OF THE WELL</b>
</h3>

<p>As soon as the after-dinner siesta was at an
end, Grey Puss, contrary to custom, called her
kittens together with soft, alluring miauws,
and took them for the first time along the
secret, winding path she had trodden through
the corn.</p>

<p>In the baking sunshine, while the countryside
was enjoying its Sabbath-day’s rest from
toil, she led them out to a large, sweet-smelling
haystack. Farther they were not allowed
to follow her.</p>

<p>She placed them in a hollow, which she
made deep and roomy, at the foot of the stack.
It was as if she understood that they needed to
see something fresh and for a time get right
away from their gloomy grave-home. They
spent the afternoon lying together in the sweet
yielding hay.... Presently the babies fell
asleep, and Grey Puss stole away.</p>

<p>Oh, the luxury of lying at rest on a summer
day, dozing in the soft, warm breeze as it
sighs between hill and dale; to escape for once
from one’s tail and the never-ceasing crawling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of one’s paws; to float body and soul along
a broad, shining river of light and not know a
single want or care!</p>

<p>The whisper of the reeds from the pond,
the song of the larks from the heavens, the
whistle of the wild chervil stems, and the
rustle of the osier leaves, unite in a hymn of
peace, caressing and soothing the slumberers’
ears—until the booming of a passing bee calls
them back to consciousness for two long,
drowsy seconds....</p>

<p>“Ears—must you hear? Eyes—must you
see? Nose—must you smell?”</p>

<p>“No, no—just rest, slumber, sleep....”</p>

<p>The fluff of the dandelion floats slowly past;
over them chases the swift, scythe-winged
swallow; while the lark’s eternal, monotonous
song slowly mends the thread broken by the
kittens when they fell asleep.</p>

<p>They wake; glide imperceptibly from the
far into the near; yawn and stretch each limb;
and finally open their eyes, saturated with the
sweetness of that kind of repose which urges
instant action.</p>

<p>The heat of the sun toasts them until their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
fur sparkles.... They get up and look at
once for something to do.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Not far from the stack was a large liquid-manure
well with a rotten, worm-eaten lid.</p>

<p>In places the lid dipped dangerously; it
was a wretched bridge over a dangerous well—but
it could bear a little kitten’s weight,
surely?</p>

<p>Flies gathered in masses on the sun-baked
lid, forming black, restless shadows on its
tarred-felt covering. Big-kitten saw at once
that they offered sport. And he soon found
it just as nice to eat them as it was exciting to
catch them.</p>

<p>He had not been at it long before the others
followed suit. But no one could compete
with him in accuracy; he displayed at once
the master hand....</p>

<p>Sitting quietly on his tail, he brought down
his paw with unerring accuracy, as if it were
the most natural thing in the world, upon
every fly that ventured within range.</p>

<p>White, wishing to emulate his performance,
came and sat beside him; but before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
very long had to acknowledge that the new
game was more difficult than it appeared.</p>

<p>She then tried crawling on her belly in
pursuit of the restless creatures, and managed
indeed to approach quite near to them; but
each time she made her spring they flew away
too soon.</p>

<p>Grey and Red were more fortunate. Each
one took up a position on the lid, and with
raised paw waited until the fly of its own
accord came within striking distance. In
this way they managed to catch a few flies,
but far from all; Red was especially erratic,
and missed two or three shots out of every
four.</p>

<p>Black, on the other hand, after a little
practise, proved himself an excellent shot;
but, unhappily, he struck with such violence
that the victim was smashed into a black spot,
the edible fragments of which were buried
in the tar.</p>

<p>Fly-catching did not interest Tiny. He
hopped and jumped in happy ignorance on the
yielding well-cover, playing prettily with his
own tail. He also derived much pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
from a rickety old hoisting-apparatus, climbing
gaily up and down the disused pump-spear.</p>

<p>Round the rotten cover grew a border of
sweet-smelling wild camomile, in the midst of
which stuck up a few stray blades of rye. An
occasional bee or butterfly, attracted by the
scent, settled on the odorous blooms.</p>

<p>When a little pearl-winged “Blue-bird”
appeared dancing above them, the kittens all
deserted their fly-catching and with one
accord sprang high in the air after it.</p>

<p>On this occasion Black disappeared abruptly
and mysteriously into the bowels of the
earth! A little dust from the broken board
rose in the air behind him.</p>

<p>The others continued the chase, and Big-kitten
succeeded in capturing the butterfly;
he was lucky enough to clap his paws upon it
as he clutched wildly in the air. In the
silence following the capture, it was carefully
and thoroughly investigated. The wings
came off, and the body came in two ...
and Big, in his scientific ardour, even tried to
find out what was inside!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>They missed Black occasionally; but after
all, there was plenty without him!</p>

<p>Exhausted with fly- and butterfly-catching,
the children lie down on the lid and rest in
the sun, listening with puzzled frowns to a
new and strange sound which comes from beneath
them. It sounds like a toad splashing
through wet grass in the rain....</p>

<p>Black-kitten paddles round in the filthy
liquid manure. He has not the slightest notion
of what it is he is treading in; but he
uses his legs vigorously, for otherwise his nose
complains that it lacks air. He has several
times reached the walls and sought vainly to
escape; but now luckily he stumbles against
the wooden pump, the wood of which offers
a better surface for his claws than the hard,
unyielding bricks.</p>

<p>He pulls himself up out of the cesspool and
climbs towards the streak of light, until he
reaches a cross-piece, where he is able to
snatch a breathing-space. He whimpers and
miauws, summons up strength, and climbs
farther—and as there is ample space between
pump and lid, owing to the straw that once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
supported the pump in the hole having almost
rotted away, he suddenly dumbfounds his
callous relatives by pushing up his head into
their midst.</p>

<p>It is the only part of him which is still at
all recognizable: the rest of his black fur has
become quite brown! He looks like a
chocolate cat—but he smells otherwise! His
brothers and sisters shrink back from him, and
spit and hiss as if he were a stranger.</p>

<p>When Grey Puss later on miauwed herself
into view with a captured mouse and warm
milk, he was at last declared genuine, and in
addition enfolded in her arms. But Big
shirked his washing duties that afternoon!
He licked his mother, it is true, but only on
the neck and in the ears; no one else received
attention from his lavish tongue.</p>

<p>The clever little cat-mother, realized quite
well what had happened, and at once shifted
her family from their dangerous summer-house
back to their old home. Well satisfied
with the security of the burial-mound, she
left her children clustered round the giant
stones enjoying the sunset, while she herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
curled up in the entrance hole and fell asleep.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_95"></a>THE DRAGON-FLY</b>
</h3>

<p>A red-gold beam of light came from
heaven, poured over the landscape through a
mighty window in the clouds, and tinged with
mauve the heavy well-lid’s brittle edges. It
lit up Grey Puss’ colours and the kittens’
glossy coats: Black remained black and Grey
remained grey; but Red turned to deeper red
and White changed to gold.</p>

<p>The evening breezes began to blow, setting
the ryefield’s crowded stalks a-whispering, and
carrying in their wake the strong, delicious
odour of new bread. The aspen leaves
blinked and waved, sending the departing
summer day a last farewell.</p>

<p>A large brown-gold “bird,” with four wings
and a long, stiff tail, came pitching with
jerky, irregular flight towards the kittens.
The lure of the chase seized them all, and
they crouched down among the stones and
waited....</p>

<p>The dragon-fly turned with a crackling
sound; White and Tiny shrank back; Grey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
drew his hind legs farther in under him;
Black’s tail thickened and his hair rose. Only
Big-kitten’s fighting lust remained unshaken;
he gathered himself together for a spring, and
the others noticed that his eyes shone with a
curious flickering gleam.</p>

<p>The next time the dragon-fly swooped,
White, Red and Tiny bolted hurriedly into
cover. Grey felt shaky, but stood his ground
bravely, while Black hissed, and lunged with
his paw.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly pitches farther ... and,
rolling perilously over as it turns, makes a
wide circle through the gold, flaming light
crowning the sea of rye ... then comes
crackling swiftly back again, fleeing already
from the approaching twilight. But this time
the insolent, many-winged “bird” does not escape!
While Black snorts and strikes with
his paw, Big leaps aloft and hangs his claws
together on the luckless creature in its flight.</p>

<p>It was Big-cat’s first important catch. And
it was devoured with general satisfaction,
especially its fat, large-eyed head.</p>

<p>Thus continued week after week the happy
family life on the mound.</p>

<p>Still no sign of any danger from without.
The corn is now so tall that no “human”
would think of tramping through it merely to
approach a common, tumble-down burial-mound.
It forms a stormless ocean round
their island home.</p>

<p>The merry, light-hearted little pussies now
begin to show signs of growth. Their faces
are larger and more intelligent, their bodies
smooth and supple, their legs disproportionately
long, and their tails less short and
scraggy. Each kitten’s character and personality
grows more apparent with every day
that passes.</p>

<p>When evening comes they creep away from
the mound to play, and all night long they
prowl about near their home, exploring the
immediate neighbourhood. They examine
carefully everything of interest they find, and
are soon well acquainted with the mouse’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
hiding-place and the small bird’s favourite
haunt.</p>

<p>In addition they make longer expeditions—sometimes
in twos and threes, sometimes alone—down
across the fields, through the plough-furrows,
and along the hedge and ditch.</p>

<p>One day they make their first important
catch—a mouse which has been left, half-crippled,
by a crow. Grey hears the mouse
first, Big springs upon it, while Black deals
it a blow which makes it roll over. Red
almost succeeded in bolting off with it, but
White and Tiny blocked the road. Who
finally <i>ate</i> the mouse could not be decided.
One thing, however, they were all agreed on:
a moment later there was no mouse left!</p>

<p>Some time afterwards, Black, who always
preferred prowling about alone, was passing
the place where the mouse had been slaughtered
when he met the original captor of the
mouse, long since digested.</p>

<p>It was a grey bird with black wings, and
a black, long-nosed head. It fluttered superciliously
backwards and forwards from one
molehill to another. Several times it turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
its head and looked attentively at the kitten;
and, when Black continued to creep along in
its wake, it hopped up on an adjacent molehill
to get a closer view of its pursuer.</p>

<p>This put Black on his mettle! He dropped
flat to the ground and crawled forward on his
stomach; but just as he arrived within springing
distance it spread its wings and flapped
with ostentatious slowness to another molehill.</p>

<p>Thus ended Black’s first encounter with the
cunning old crow.</p>

<b><a id="newlink_100"></a>BIG-KITTEN</b>
</h3>

<p>Thick-set and sturdy, with short
tail, strong legs, and a back which
merged smoothly into a plump, round
stomach; big, attentive eyes with intelligence
and intensity in their glance; small ears never
at rest; this was Big!</p>

<p>He was the born master-hunter of the litter,
and spent nearly all his time lying in wait
on his belly, his tail stretched out behind him.
He captured in a flash every bit of fluff carried
past by the wind; he pursued passionately
every butterfly and bird that came near him.
When one of his brothers or sisters got up
and walked away, Big-kitten would look up
with a start and steal cautiously in the wake
of the “meat.”...</p>

<p>He was always the one to start a new game
... and he commenced every game of “tag”
with a leap right over his playfellow; a deliberate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
insult which emphasized his opponent’s
inferiority.</p>

<p>Although Big was still only a little half-grown
fellow, his paws itched with the lust
of the chase, and in his mind smouldered a
constant desire for adventure. During the
noonday hour of rest he would push out recklessly
from the island-fortress, and, when the
weather was dry and warm, creep far away
out along the hedge and ditch bordering the
corn.</p>

<p>Inbred in him was the ability to make use
of every scrap of cover offered by Mother
Nature, whether a tiny depression in the
ground, or a tuft of grass, behind which he
would hide and listen patiently before
proceeding on his way. With doubled-up
legs and body dragging along the ground he
could creep for half-hours at a time, hiding
in a bush or copse when he wished to rest or
stretch his muscles.</p>

<p>His movements were so light and deft that
he barely disturbed the grass—no shaking
flower or trembling stalk ever betrayed <i>his</i>
passage!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>One day he went farther than usual along
the ditch.... He had found a splendid
hunting-ground! Flies and swallows swept
over him in crowds. Now he <i>must</i> do something
big!</p>

<p>He exerted all his powers to the uttermost:
lifted his feet high to avoid scraping and
rustling, crawled up at frequent intervals on
stones to look around, and often sat still listening
with his head stretched high above the
grass. His ears were instantly directed
towards every sound, while simultaneously he
crouched ready to spring....</p>

<p>His efforts were crowned with success; he
came upon a weird, earth-like little animal
which sat digging at a hole. He should have
sprung upon it at once, but he hesitated.
Then the earthy one started up and ran off,
disappearing with a final hop into an adjacent
bush.</p>

<p>In the bush sat a young starling with broken
wing, enjoying the view, and under the
impression that it had reached safety at last.</p>

<p>Not many days before it had slipped out of
its nest; the down of childhood still lingered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
on its body. What a long, long time it had
already lived, thought the little fellow!</p>

<p>How it had wonderingly stared out of the
nest, peeping through the branches after its
mother as she flew away in search of
food!...</p>

<p>With what a shiver of dread it had, one
fine morning for the first time in its life, set
foot upon the ground!... There was something
about the ground which frightened it
dreadfully; true, the earth could not run and
jump, but nevertheless the little bird didn’t
feel at all safe there. It longed to go aloft—aloft
and flying!</p>

<p>The first minor difficulties were soon overcome.
It learnt to glide through the air from
branch to branch. Then suddenly it found
itself really flying, able to turn and twist and
sweep round in curves, to swerve upwards in
spirals and suddenly turn and corkscrew down
again. It had become master of its destiny—the
world was big and the earth beautiful,
for real <i>life</i> had begun.</p>

<p>Then one day it had flown into the farmer’s
kitchen garden, which twinkled with flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
glowed with fruit; red and tempting they
lay upon the ground, for it was strawberry
season. There came a shot!</p>

<p>Something queer happened: all at once,
after a loud noise, it found itself unable to
rise and fly aloft; it could only hop clumsily
in the air.</p>

<p>It ran and ran, tearing away in the direction
of the long-drawn whistle of terror which
the other birds uttered as they flew away.
Now it sat quite still under the bush, awaiting
the inevitable doom which comes to every
crippled bird.</p>

<p>For days it had hopped about, getting
farther and farther out into the field....</p>

<p>Big-kitten made very short work of it; his
victim sat waiting as <a id="if"></a>if put there for him by
the Creator. To capture it was child’s play.</p>

<p>Thus did the world with its colours and
sounds vanish from the consciousness of the
little brown starling.... Sharp teeth buried
themselves in its neck and greedy lips sucked
its blood.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_104"></a>THE CONQUEROR</b>
</h3>

<p>Big-kitten would not devour his booty on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the spot. In addition to being a great hunter,
he was very fond of bragging of his exploits.
He started, therefore, on the return journey
at once, in order to display his booty outside
the cat borough.</p>

<p>Forward through the green grass he treads,
slowly and carefully. His white forepaws
appear first ... as if feeling their way; then
follow the round head, plump body, and
gently swishing tail. His jaws seem enormous,
and his neck looks swollen—but this is
because he is carrying the bird in his mouth.</p>

<p>He grips it by the middle; head and neck
dangle down on one side, legs and tail stick
out on the other; while along the ground drag
its limp wings, on which his forepaws keep
treading and delaying his progress....</p>

<p>Presently he puts his burden down for a
breathing-space—now he picks it up again;
his hairless little red nose-tip flattens out, and
his yellow, slanting eyes close viciously as he
crunches it in his teeth.</p>

<p>As it happens, none of the others are outside
the hole when he arrives, so that he
receives no immediate applause; he therefore
begins to run about miauwing, which soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
fetches out the whole band. They shall view
him as conqueror!</p>

<p>With the young starling dangling from his
jaws and his tail hoisted proudly he swaggers
in among them. He twitches a wing tantalizingly
under their noses, making them snap
jealously at it. At last he lies down and
devours his booty with exasperating calmness
and deliberation.</p>

<p>However, the young starling is more than
he can manage at one sitting, and when he
is satisfied he begins to play with the remains.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, of course, it is dead; but he
does everything possible to make it <i>seem</i>
alive!</p>

<p>He takes it between his forepaws and casts
it high in the air, then catches it with a deep,
savage growl. He puts it in front of him
and gives it a push, causing it to jerk forward.
This stimulates his imagination enormously;
he thinks the bird is about to escape, and
quickly thrusts his claws into it.</p>

<p>Again, with rapid touches of his paws he
brushes the starling towards him, at the same
time jumping back quickly—and now in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
haste he rolls over backwards and lies there,
juggling ecstatically with the dead bird.</p>

<p>Surrounding him, but hidden behind stone
and hillock, his brothers and sisters, with ears
stiff and whiskers quivering, wait and watch
... perhaps a miracle will happen and the
bird fly towards one of them....</p>

<p>Just then a sea-gull comes sweeping past
the mound, and, startled at seeing the kitten
flock just beneath it, drops a jet of white,
which hits the victor on the forehead and
nose....</p>

<p>Big makes a leap upwards at the sharp-shooter,
and afterwards, feeling the need of
a good wash, forgets for a time all about the
starling.</p>

<p>When he returns it has vanished! Tiny
sits with a most innocent expression on his
face, and Red had a feather in his whiskers!</p>

<p>He ought really to have trounced the two
impudent brutes; but it was beneath his dignity—besides,
he was full to the brim. He
could go out into the field and catch another
one if he liked—he was quite certain he
could!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_108"></a>BLACK-KITTEN</b>
</h3>

<p>This was a fellow to be handled carefully!</p>

<p>He returned snarl and spit for a kind word—and
he never hit softly on the nose, but
scratched so that it hurt. He did not understand
fun, but took everything in dead earnest;
and in consequence was always quarrelling
with his brothers and sisters. They knew
him well enough by now, and only as a last
resource, when there was nobody else about
to play with, would one make the best of a
bad job and take Black. In revenge he
mixed in a game of his own accord whenever
it suited him, and that in a most aggressive
and unpleasant manner.</p>

<p>He was strong and well built; but he had
large paws—and worse still, an ugly face!</p>

<p>A high-arched forehead protruded abruptly
over unusually deep-set eyes. The eyes themselves
were golden-green in colour—and some
thing angry and evil perpetually obscured
their glance, like a murky cloud over a clear
horizon. And the wildness in the eyes was
emphasized by the almost constantly pressed-back
ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>He was extremely skilful at climbing trees!
His insulting and provocative behaviour often
resulted in a general assault upon him, and
when things became desperate he invariably
went aloft.</p>

<p>To get up was easy enough—all the kittens
could do that; but none of them could come
down like Black. The others slid and scrambled
down, thereby ruffling their fur and
blunting their claws; he, on the contrary, had
the real tree-climber’s blood, having inborn
in him the art of descending in successive
jumps, a number of short falls, which he
checked at the right moment by sticking all
four batches of claws into the tree-trunk.</p>

<p>As time passed, he became as much at home
in the trees as a marten, and could spring
from top to top with the skill and agility of a
squirrel. It is doubtful whether any other
cat than he could have escaped from the
manure-well.</p>

<p>Just as the secret of Samson’s strength was
hidden in the giant’s growth of hair, so was
Black’s concealed in his claw-daggers; he
spent, indeed, every spare moment in sharpening
his claws!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>He was nearly always to be seen by the old
gate-post, where he squatted down and reached
up with his forepaws, listening contentedly
to the scratching of his claws on the hard,
bone-dry wood. He always finished off by
stropping them, stroking them forwards and
backwards over the corner of the post until
they were as sharp as shoemakers’ bradawls.</p>

<p>None of the others possessed weapons like
these!</p>

<p>And as he grew up and began to catch
things, he deceived by means of them even
experienced old birds! Thus, one day an old
male sparrow taking a leisurely dust-bath fell
a victim to his precocity. The sparrow, with
the wisdom of his years, thought, “Piff! it’s
only a kitten!” And it flew up just in time
to escape—if Black <i>had</i> been an ordinary
kitten!</p>

<p>But that was its mistake—just as the chameleon
with its lightning-like tongue reaches the
distant insect, so did Black at the critical
moment succeed in thrusting forward his
claws and reaching the bird.</p>

<p>These terrible claws of his in reality made
his forepaws abnormally long—a fact which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
his brothers and sisters also had long since
discovered!</p>

<p>When Mother Puss sat dissecting her spoil
and Black-kitten came too near, she used at
first to lash out at Master Impudence. But
Master Impudence lashed back! It was as
if he said, “You must make room for me,
too!” And the old she-cat soon learned to
respect him for his swift, scratchy boxes on
the ear.</p>

<p>In general he was timid and solitary....
The moment the kittens heard people on the
field-path near by, he would arch his back,
thicken his fur, and hurriedly run to cover.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_111"></a>MIAUW-MIAUW—MIAUW-MIAUW</b>
</h3>

<p>Black made one of his first expeditions at
the time when the wheat was just high enough
to hide him. He sauntered defiantly through
it, caring not a jot whether the ground
beneath were wet or dry. Long, dark cloud-shadows
came hurtling along and surrounded
him; the bluish-green wheat became black,
making it impossible to distinguish him as he
crawled through its depths.</p>

<p>But once, when the sky was clear and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
sun unrolled its carpet of light before his
eyes, he caught sight of a little brown speck
among the green stems. His legs disappeared
in his fur, and his body lengthened
out, as he pushed chin, neck, belly, and tail
slowly along the ground.... Now he could
see that the spot was a bird, so fat and heavy
that it weighed down the thistle-top on which
it sat.</p>

<p>Suddenly came a hoarse scream from the
air: “Kra, kra!”</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a peewit fluttered round
his ears. It had come from behind and
caught him in the act; he had been so
absorbed in his sport that he had forgotten
to keep a look out.</p>

<p>He refused to flee; he just sat there slashing
with his tail while the wide-awake flying-corps
of birds did sentry duty above!</p>

<p>Two crows hung low on flapping wings
just over his head, scolding and cursing him
until his hair vibrated with fury. The pair
of peewits goaded him to frenzy by attacking
alternately from behind and before, while the
stupid larks came and sat on the gate-post
not far off to watch the fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>He had to give up all hope of that speck
on the thistle-top; but just to have seen it and
to have got so near to it seemed to him, nevertheless,
something of an adventure.</p>

<p>For a long time he wandered about in vain,
sniffing the flowers, but at last, just by a heap
of stones, he found a new brown speck. Had
he been experienced and realized what he
was after, he would perhaps have hesitated;
as it was, he rejoiced in happy ignorance,
and sprang.</p>

<p>The brown speck—which was a young
weasel out on the same errand as himself—sprang
with a whine into the air. It was
instantly fully alive to its danger! Although
thin as a lath and not longer than a mole, it
showed him at once by its grin that it possessed
teeth by no means inferior to his own.</p>

<p>But Black did not mean to be cheated of
his spoil a second time; he attacked suddenly
and recklessly, metamorphosed in a flash from
a black shadow into a living, vicious beast.</p>

<p>With hair on end and eyes gleaming phosphorescent
in the twilight, he made his
spring.</p>

<p>The young weasel jumped aside, giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
him at the same time a sharp little nip in
the neck. Its methods resembled rather those
of a pole-cat; for it did not attack openly, but
kept darting in from the side and from behind
with quick, cunning little feints.</p>

<p>The little vermin was possessed of a devil;
but Black for the moment was possessed of
two! He could be a young tiger when he
chose—and, undaunted by the wound in his
neck, he dealt the weasel a lightning blow with
his forepaw, following it up with a murderous
bite through the snout which rendered
his enemy helpless.</p>

<p>The weasel writhed frenziedly in his grip;
but the tiger-kitten killed it off-hand, as if it
were a mere mouse. He thought that his
spoil smelled rather strongly; but he was too
young and hungry to be dainty....</p>

<p>He picks it up and makes for home ...
arrives via ditch and furrow in the vicinity
of the burial-mound. Anyone on the field-path?
He is quite close to it, and knows he
must cross it. In the ordinary way he prefers
walking along it, but not when carrying
booty. Supposing one of his brothers or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
sisters should meet him and try to take it from
him! He wants to enjoy his meal in peace—with
hide and hair and intestines and all!
He has no wish to fight twice over for the
same spoil; nor does he want to lose his feast
and spoil the pleasure of victory by being
compelled to share with others.</p>

<p>The electric sheen in his black fur becomes
more brilliant, and his eyes strain forward
on the alert, as he steals cautiously along
absorbed in his thoughts of his victory and the
feast to come.</p>

<p>Again comes that hoarse “kra-ing” from
the air!</p>

<p>The previous day he had been shown the
necessity of concealment when tracking his
game; now he was to learn that it was even
more necessary after the game was caught.</p>

<p>That fool of a crow has once more sneaked
up behind him! It hangs over his head jealous
of his prize, while it advertises to the
whole world what he has in his mouth.</p>

<p>His triumph is to be marred, then, after
all!</p>

<p>From all directions stream his brothers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
sisters, headed by old Mother Grey Puss; she
approaches with electrified back-fur anxious
as to what may be the matter.</p>

<p>They come nearer, but they cannot understand
what he is doing! He sits doubled over
something he is trying to hide. His ears are
flattened and his eyes glitter with anxiety,
and they can hear from afar off how he snarls
and threatens.</p>

<p>Now Grey Puss herself dares not approach
nearer; his multifarious noises of warning
become more and more continuous....</p>

<p>The frightened kittens press closer to her;
the entire family is overawed and silent; for
the first time they hear an angry he-cat’s
sombre, booming music. “Su-wau-wau-wau
... mau, mau, mau....”</p>

<p>And he gnashes his teeth until it harmonizes
with the plashing of his slaver.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_116"></a>GREY-KITTEN</b>
</h3>

<p>Such a short-legged little cat was surely
never seen before! She seemed rather to
crawl and glide over the ground than to walk.
She had inherited her mother’s disproportionately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
large hare-like ears, and had a far
keener sense of hearing than any of the other
kittens. The slightest sound brought her
head up with a jerk, her ears directed instantly
in the exact direction of the sound, while
cunning and deceit flashed into her usually
trustful eyes. Hers was a quiet, thoughtful
nature, which apparently never waxed very
enthusiastic over anything; it was as if she
pondered carefully every step she took!</p>

<p>She could sit still for hours at a time, with
her tail curled carefully round her neatly
gathered paws, and watch the doings of the
others. An enormous degree of patience and
the ability to wait characterized her nature;
they all thought she slept, but it was not so;
she saw and heard everything.</p>

<p>She often crept round the foot of the mound
and down along the ditch and fence—and
whenever she found a little hole in the earth
which looked as if it were inhabited, she
would sit down and watch, if necessary for
hours. This monotonous waiting for game
suited her nature perfectly; however bad the
state of the ground or of the weather, it made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
no difference to her—she bore it all with
good-natured indifference.</p>

<p>Lying thus in wait was a treat to her. Her
sense of hearing was so keen that she found
sufficient entertainment in listening to the
subterranean rumblings of her prey. Minute
linked itself to minute with lightning speed;
and although to an onlooker it seemed that
nothing in the world was happening, in reality
she was experiencing thrills of anticipation
all the time.</p>

<p>She was also an expert at catching dragon-flies,
although indeed in another manner than
brother Big. She could, as it were, hypnotize
them down to her. When a dragon-fly was
performing acrobatics above her head, she
just sat still and stared and stared, until
presently the insect, whether attracted by her
colouring or by her eyes, came so close that
she had only to put out a paw and knock it
down.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One evening, while the setting sun bathes
the burial-mound in its red splendour, and
the giant stones shine as if coated with pink
enamel, she creeps out to the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>The windows of the farm flash with light,
and over the white, bulging summer clouds
falls a scarlet, claret-bordered veil. Everywhere
she goes she hears the munching of
grass: horses and cattle are feeding after the
day’s exertion....</p>

<p>She peeps to the right; to the left—and
listens.</p>

<p>Then sits down softly—and listens, listens....
Is there anything? No! Then forward,
silently forward....</p>

<p>With crouching loins and curved tail, but
with chest raised and neck stretched high,
she writhes through the grass, as if treading
on flames.</p>

<p>A sudden halt—a careful investigation!
No; false alarm again! And Grey creeps
along until she finds another mouse-hole....</p>

<p>The twilight falls, and the great black maybugs
begin to wind their sound-threads round
her. A horse has dropped some manure
close to where she sits—the mice like making
their holes under that!</p>

<p>The dike-chat flutters past with its young.
The little grey birds are swallowed up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
darkness, leaving behind only a flicker from
their white tails.</p>

<p>The slim young hare hops with supple grace
across the field, stopping to sniff at each root
and plant....</p>

<p>Grey sits patiently before her mouse-hole,
listening to the faint scratching of its owner’s
feet deep down in the earth. The minutes
race; her mind is utterly absorbed with the
one thrilling subject—mouse!</p>

<p>Presently a distant rumble rises to her ears;
grains of sand are rolling down the tunnel.
The sound, which no human ear could hope
to distinguish, increases in volume until it
culminates in a faint flap: a baby mouse with
thin white legs and a tail three times as long
as its body crouches curled up at the entrance!</p>

<p>Without straightening its body, it begins
at once to propel itself forward through the
grass-stems, looking for all the world like a
living bullet on legs....</p>

<p>Now the noise of its running has stopped
... the mouse swarms up and down the
straws, so that they whine like violin-strings
in the cat’s ears. Her soul is a sound board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
on which each whine impinges, magnified and
vibrating.... In the most approved fashion
she creeps upon her prey, and, in spite of a
clumsy spring, manages to nail it down under
her paw....</p>

<p>It was Grey-kitten’s first mouse; and she
felt she would never tire of gazing at it. Her
tail wriggled without ceasing and her eyes
shone with delight ... to think that those
tiny mouse-legs could make such a frightful
to-do!</p>

<p>She could not bring herself to eat it, but
must keep it to rejoice over on her way home.
Every few minutes she stopped, dropped the
luckless victim in front of her, and began to
play with it.</p>

<p>And, like Big, she was stupid enough to
appear with it before the whole family; even
going so far as to throw it down on the ground
for general admiration.</p>

<p>She paid dearly for that! She never did it
again!</p>

<b><a id="newlink_122"></a>WHITE-KITTEN</b>
</h3>

<p>When the wind brought word of
human beings on the field-path, the
kittens always stopped their play.</p>

<p>Grey Puss had warned them in their
earliest days to beware of people, and as a
rule her angry growling called them down
into the hole. Now, however, when she spent
less and less of her time at home, and the
kittens were left to themselves, their behaviour
varied according to their natures.</p>

<p><a id="Big_Puss"></a>Big Puss and Tiny still ran for the hole;
Black thrilled—he sank down on his loins and
dragged himself along the ground, keeping
a sharp lookout and disappearing periodically
with a spitting noise. Grey and Red
as a rule remained placidly lying still; but
White stiffened her tail with delight and
trotted to and fro, mewing and purring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>She was a merry and friendly little kitten,
who made a joke of everything. Her strong
desire for amusement and her inability to
appreciate the stern realities of life expressed
themselves at a very early stage of her existence.
Just as she regularly seized the opportunity
of chasing her mother’s tail, so did
she often make a plaything of the old cat’s
nipples, a sacrilege which more than once lost
her her due share of milk.</p>

<p>She was not specially big or strong in
appearance, but doubtless her grace and
good humour would carry her far in the
world.</p>

<p>She spent most of her time making her
toilet. She could not bear the smallest piece
of fluff on her coat without at once licking it
off. If so much as a single hair of hers
smelled slightly, she felt upset until she had
succeeded in removing the cause of her indisposition.
During her idle hours—and
they were many—she would sit a little apart
from the others, spit on her paw, with which
she would wash her breast and stomach,
freshen up her eyes, smooth the fur on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
face, and make a parting right across the
middle of her forehead.</p>

<p>In her charming little cat-face, with its
soft, affectionate expression, were set two
glistening, watery-blue eyes, which slanted as
prettily as those of a clean and well-groomed
little Geisha girl.</p>

<p>In company with Tiny she still took suck
from her mother, and there was as yet no sign
of this form of nourishment being abandoned.
Being so much together with her little brother,
she did her best to chum up with him.
But the latter, who was cleverer than he
looked, realized too well the disadvantage of
such an entanglement, and rejected her advances
point-blank; she should rather do as he
did, find a big brother with whom to join
forces.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_124"></a>TINY</b>
</h3>

<p>Tiny was, neither in appearance nor reality,
a Hercules, being thin and stunted, with a
large head and big, intelligent eyes.</p>

<p>For the most part he lay still and slept.
He had an attitude of his own which he preferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
when resting: doubled up, with his
hind legs well under his body, and his
absurdly big head between his paws. It
seemed almost as if he were trying to shut his
ears against the ceaseless hurly-burly around
him.</p>

<p>He gave rather the impression of being
slow-witted and sedate; but in reality he was
not such a fool as he appeared.</p>

<p>For example, he possessed one unique
characteristic: he was an infallible weather-prophet!</p>

<p>His talent in this direction, however, would
have remained quite useless had he kept his
prophecies to himself; but, on the contrary,
the moment a change of weather was impending,
he could not resist giving vent to his feelings.
The others then knew at once what to
expect.</p>

<p>For example, supposing he felt rainy
weather approaching, he would walk about
shaking himself, dragging his tail, and mewing
continuously. Then he would seek out a
good hiding-place where he could lie in
warmth and shelter when the rain came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>But when fine weather was to be expected,
he would appear with tail at the perpendicular,
purring and humming with satisfaction.</p>

<p>In reality he was not only a professor of
weather, he was more: he was a regular little
meteorological observatory! Possibly the terrible
treatment once meted out to him in
his earlier days by his brutal father accounted
for his weak, supersensitive nerves.</p>

<p>Brother Black—the fighter—whose frequent
mad expeditions he followed at a
distance in order to be at hand at the right
time to beg his livelihood, soon learned to
utilize his small brother’s eccentricity.</p>

<p>Black preferred hunting at nightfall; but
if, during the day, when crouching at his gate-post
stropping his claws, he observed Tiny
walking about miauling and crying, he knew
at once he must get away as early as possible:
it would rain that night.</p>

<p>Black could never resist Tiny’s cadging.
His admiring looks and respectful mien were
too much for the fierce warrior.</p>

<p>In addition, the little fellow suffered
seriously from vomiting. The excess of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
feathers and the insufficiency of meat comprising
his diet soon ruined his digestion; he had
to go out and chew harsh, bitter cock’s-foot
grass the moment he awoke.</p>

<p>In spite of this, he was the sole humorist
of the family—thanks to his unusually long
tail, the vigour of which was so extraordinary
that it gave the impression of being a separate
personality. He would wipe his paws on it,
or twist it right round his neck; it was a constant
source of amusement; he could even
play “postman’s knock” with it.</p>

<p>But on the whole, his abilities and characteristics
were much below the average, and
he might safely be expected to turn out a
failure.</p>

<p>When, by chance or design, he <i>did</i> go out
on his own, he succeeded occasionally in
making a catch of some sort by means of his
abnormally acute powers of observation.</p>

<p>Thus, one day he saw a yellow-hammer
settle in a tuft of withered grass; he hurried
to the spot—and gulped down a most delicious
omelet!</p>

<p>Another day he met a bunting fighting with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
a lark. By tacit understanding the hedge
belonged to the bunting just as the field belonged
to the lark, and neither permitted the
other to trespass in his sphere of action—so
they fought, and whirled round and round,
until they both lay dead-beat in the grass.</p>

<p>Such a battle Tiny was a master-hand at
turning to his own advantage.</p>

<p>He began to consider it worth while to
slip out and look round. There was always
something or other to be caught!</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_128"></a>RED-KITTEN</b>
</h3>

<p>Whatever doubt there may have been as to
Tiny’s being a sly puss, it was quite certain
that Red-kitten was a deceitful hussy!</p>

<p>Her coat alone stamped her as a mountebank,
being fox-red in colour, with bright
yellow stripes which turned to rings round
her legs and tail.</p>

<p>Her body also was unique, being long, thin,
and supple, and gave as she walked, like a
freshly stuffed sofa.</p>

<p>She had a mania for stretching herself, as
if she <i>could</i> not get her body slim and supple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
enough. None could compare with her in
activity; she was incessantly playing tricks on
the others—and when they attacked her she
could easily wriggle out of their clutches, even
Black and Big being unable to hold her.</p>

<p>A gymnast, a juggler, was Red!</p>

<p>In addition to her bodily virtues she had
tall, slim legs, which, when necessary, enabled
her to escape from the swiftest opponent by
sheer speed.</p>

<p>She was still quite young when Box one
day surprised her in the middle of the field;
but, thanks to her speed, she saved herself at
the last moment by scrambling up on a straw
thatch, her mouth extended and the water
running down her red tongue. Had there
been a man on the scene he would have said
that it was the first time he had seen a cat
<i>sweat</i>!</p>

<p>Her cunning, flame-coloured eyes are seldom
really open; she usually goes about with
them screwed up, as if desiring to conceal
their lowering, deceitful glance.</p>

<p>She is always to be seen sneaking round
stones and molehills, and likes jumping out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
suddenly and unexpectedly. When the others
play puss-in-the-corner, she prefers to lie in
ambush and spring upon the nearest from behind,
knock him down, and maul him about.</p>

<p>She beats all the others in cunning, and
they do not like her to be near when they are
eating; they know from experience her extraordinary
skill in stealing.</p>

<p>On the day Mother Grey Puss brought
home the herrings, each kitten was apportioned
a lump of the delicious food. Big,
who had received the head, sat a little apart
from the others, nibbling it thoughtfully.</p>

<p>There was still a piece of the jaw left; it
lay just in front of him, as with closed eyes
he swallowed blissfully a tasty mouthful.
When he opened his eyes again the herring
jaw was no longer there—and a red tail-tip
vanished silently behind the nearest boulder.</p>

<p>Nature, as a rule, equips each of her creatures
generously with at least one special
talent; and, provided only it uses that talent,
the struggle for life is an easy one.</p>

<p>And Red’s talent was—thieving!</p>

<p>One can never take her by surprise: she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
possesses extraordinary decision of character,
coupled with extreme cautiousness; and she
never resorts to force until her prey is at her
mercy. Her daily struggle for food and her
constant intercourse with her talented brothers,
whose highly specialized skill in trapping
was so much superior to her own, have
developed her inbred tendency to steal, whenever
<i>her</i> special characteristics make it possible.</p>

<p>She is an expert at starting a quarrel when
the others sit devouring their spoil; and while
they fight, she fishes in troubled waters. She
hunts indeed, but after her own fashion; and
most of her spoil is second-hand!</p>

<p>Her sympathies are unstable; she lacks
personality! Sometimes she helps Black
against Big, at others Grey against Black; being
always on the side of the one who owns
nothing against the one who has for the
moment something to steal.... She is in
favour of common ownership, and is the red
communist of the litter!</p>

<p>But she is an adept at dissembling; she is
not only a great juggler, but also a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
hypocrite ... her tail betrays this, for in
the most exciting moments it is as stiff as a
poker!</p>

<p>In the long run, however, the narrow
bounds of catborough do not offer sufficient
scope for her predatory instincts, and she is
compelled to eke out her spoils. When Big,
Black, and Grey, with White and Tiny in
tow, slink out in the gloaming over field and
meadow and follow the twisting, irregular
paths of the village copse, Red lounges
through the field until she meets a human
track.</p>

<p>Experience has taught her that such a track
usually leads to a place where there is something
to be picked up ... some cast-away
food-paper or other, which, on investigation,
often proves to contain tasty morsels, such as
herring-bones, cheese-rind, or scraps of fat.</p>

<p>Sometimes, also, an old wooden clog or a
pair of cast-off stockings lie on the ground
near by, but they appeal to her less, and serve
only to increase her faith in human footsteps.</p>

<p>But it happens, too, that the tracks lead to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
dainties such as would make even gourmands
like Big and Black turn blue in the face with
envy!</p>

<p>The errand boys of the neighbourhood are
very keen on wandering round the hedges for
birds’ nests—not to destroy them, but merely
to feel the thrill of peeping at the eggs. Red,
aided by her cunning and her deductive faculties,
finds every single one of these nests!</p>

<p>On one occasion she raided a lark’s nest.
All night long she had followed a human
“spoor,” which led over grass and clover and
turnips. At a certain place the track stopped
and turned off abruptly towards a clump of
white marguerites.</p>

<p>Three nights in succession she came across
the same lonely track, and found it stop on
each occasion exactly at this place. And
yet there was nothing there; that was peculiar!</p>

<p>She examined the immediate surroundings
even more thoroughly, poked her nose in the
steaming scent-waves—where human foot
stood long in one place, the scent was warm;
she knew that well enough!</p>

<p>At this a bird sprang up. She thrust her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
teeth into the nest and lapped down the nearly
full-grown young greedily....</p>

<p>She had been right after all; food always
flowed where human footsteps trod!</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_134"></a>THE GREAT EATING-HOUSE</b>
</h3>

<p>During the long, still evenings sounds
could always be heard far away in the huge
“stone-heap” where most of the tracks found
by Red sooner or later ended. Often she
approached courageously quite close and sat
outside listening. Perpetual noise and disturbance
reigned within; shrill whines, deep
bellows, crowings, and cacklings penetrated
its walls. A strong animal smell, as if the
stone-heap were wrapped in an enormous
food-paper, permeated the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

<p>One evening, as she sat hidden in the corn,
she saw a man, with clogs clattering and forepaws
covered with fur, come out and walk
past.</p>

<p>The stableman had Box with him....</p>

<p>The dog scented cat, and caught a glimpse
of red fur—and now Red had to gallop for
her life through the corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Long-legged Box had almost overtaken her
when she ran up into the top of a small
willow tree, where, by exerting all her
strength, she managed to hang fast, swaying
to and fro. Box executed a wild war-dance
round the trunk, leaping up as high as he
could; when he grew tired of that, he turned
his back to the tree and howled towards the
farm for help....</p>

<p>Suddenly he hears a noise behind him.
He whirls round, but can see nothing on
account of the thick corn. He throws a
glance up at the willow-top. It is empty!</p>

<p>At last he realizes what has happened.
The red scamp has outdone him; with nose to
the scent he rushes after....</p>

<p>The spoor leads into a ditch—and Box
follows!</p>

<p>Now through a culvert under a road—and
Box rushes at full speed into the culvert! It
is lined with stones, and narrow—<i>too</i> narrow
for the dog’s well-nourished body; he sticks
fast, and can move neither forward nor back.</p>

<p>He has not even room left to bark; his ribs
are gripped as in a vice; it is all he can do
to manage a feeble, frightened whine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>All that evening he remains a prisoner in
his stone cell; during the night the water rises
and covers his paws—until at last, late next
afternoon, his body has become so emaciated
that he succeeds in squeezing backwards out
of the trap.</p>

<p>Delighted, he runs home at once to the
farm, where, however, he is subjected to the
additional humiliation of being well scolded
for his absence. How had his lordship enjoyed
himself all that time? He had perhaps
been making love in the next parish? Or
had he been camping out with the fisherman’s
yellow mongrel? Yes, he was a Don Juan,
that’s what he was; a thoroughly wicked
fellow!...</p>

<p>“Be careful!” he was threatened vaguely.
His place was in the farmyard at night to
keep guard!</p>

<p>Next day he was chained up.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One would think that Red would have been
so frightened by this narrow escape that she
would have avoided the farm and its surroundings
for the future; but it was far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
being the case—that sort of mishap had no
effect on her at all.</p>

<p>In fact, with her system of going to work,
such things were sure to happen; no need,
therefore, to take them too seriously!</p>

<p>A few evenings later she is sitting again at
the edge of the cornfield, and as nobody
comes out and no dog chases her away, it is
obvious that she is meant to gain admittance!</p>

<p>She creeps along the garden fence and
sneaks calmly past the stall to the manure-heap,
where she spends the whole night in
undisturbed peace ransacking “the big food
bag.”</p>

<p>She came back night after night; and became
more and more daring....</p>

<p>One morning early, the housewife coming
suddenly into the larder, discovered a strange
cat sitting on one of the shelves, eating. She
grabbed the broom and lunged out after the
brute, but in her excitement aimed so badly
that she transformed a large bowl of cream
into a cataract!</p>

<p>Now the farmer’s wife became really
angry! If that red devil stole cream, she’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
soon begin taking puddings and meat....</p>

<p>She hit about her wildly and futilely....
While Red escaped by the grating through
which she had come.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“<i>Was</i> it a cat?”</p>

<p>The good woman became suddenly doubtful
when she had cooled down. Nobody
round about owned such a cat, as far as she
knew....</p>

<p>Was it not rather a young fox she had
seen?...</p>

<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_139"></a>BOX</b>
</h3>

<p>Box was a mixture of every possible
race of dog.</p>

<p>His head was pointed, but his ears,
nevertheless, long and drooping, resembling
those of a Gordon setter. His short, thick,
bulldog neck was joined to a retriever body,
from beneath which shot out four long, thin
greyhound legs, and behind which dangled a
long, thin, mop-ended tail.</p>

<p>His eyes were wolf-like and shifty, and
blinked treacherously when he looked at one.
Any attempt to pat him was repulsed with a
growl and an evil suspicious glance.</p>

<p>His coat was doubtful; but his mind was
definite enough: quarrelsome, ferocious, and
snappish—ready to attack anyone or anything
upon the slightest provocation!</p>

<p>He had never been able to stand cats, a trait
doubtless inherited from some aristocratic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
sensitive-nosed ancestor.... From his very
earliest days he had found it impossible to be
on friendly terms with such musky beasts.</p>

<p>In addition he hated sheep, and loathed the
odour of cows and the stink of swine; but
however much his aristocratic instincts
were offended, he was always conscious at the
back of his mind of a certain agreeable,
<i>meaty</i> smell about them. The cat’s scent,
however, was sour and old; it smelled of
mouse, which he despised from his birth.</p>

<p>Besides, they were always wanting to share
his food with him—a habit to which he objected
strongly. They thought him asleep
when—as occasionally happened—he dozed
over a bone at noon outside his kennel; but
he was wide awake enough, and knew exactly
what their game was!</p>

<p>He really belonged to the farmer’s wife,
and was always released at her request. He
then tore round doing his amiable best to exterminate
the farm’s feline inhabitants.</p>

<p>The foreman is sitting milking in the stall,
when he is suddenly overturned and kicked
into the gutter. The cows roar frenziedly....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Box has just rushed by in pursuit of a
cat!</p>

<p>As soon as the foreman has picked himself
up, a clog comes hurtling at Box—and just
as he is disappearing crestfallen through the
door, a milk-stool catches him in the rear.</p>

<p>After this exploit he seldom ventured inside
the stall-door; but the foreman knew
well enough when the ruffian stood outside
peering through the chink, for the stall-cat’s
tail always swelled and stood to attention
immediately.</p>

<p>One day he surprised the good wife’s
favourite kitten, a little white he-cat, as it lay
sleeping in the barn; it was too slow in waking,
and was captured. The farmer chased
him with a shovel, and succeeded in recovering
the kitten, but it was dead. There was
nothing to do except break the news to his
wife, and bury the corpse.</p>

<p>After that outrage Box was chained up for
a very long time indeed. But gradually his
madness subsided so much that he learned to
recognize the “musk animals” attached to the
farm; and although he could not of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
regard them as friends, he yet respected them
for the sake of the general peace.</p>

<p>But beyond the bounds of the farm, out on
the road and in the fields, he showed no
mercy. Every cat he met there was his sworn
enemy—and he was master-hand at running
them down and killing them.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_142"></a>CATS OF ALL COLOURS</b>
</h3>

<p>Among the wheat, which is now almost
ripe, flame the poppy-torches ... the blue-stalked
corn is so thickly massed that Grey
Puss disappears completely in its depths.</p>

<p>The seething of the rye from the adjacent
field fills her sensitive ear; it is the keynote of
the summer music.</p>

<p>Out on the grass between the heaps of hay
Box sits majestically on his tail. He has
accompanied the men working in the fields,
and he feels himself one of them, especially
taking into consideration the important nature
of his sentry duty.</p>

<p>He has just been trying to facilitate the
farmer’s ploughing by digging a deep hole in
search of a mole. But the ground is too dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
and the work on the whole too tedious—he
doesn’t care about it any more! Then, far
away out on the road he sees a man walking,
and so barks at him for a time.</p>

<p>In this manner he is constantly useful!</p>

<p>At last he feels he would like a trot round....
Scarcely has he crossed the potato-field
when two partridges come running towards
him. Wow! he is upon them with a jump—and
after them in the direction in which they
shoot away on their stiff, short wings!</p>

<p>Then he catches sight of an animal emerging
from the corn. It creeps along, its body
close to the ground.... It smells, he
notices; ha, cat ... cat!</p>

<p>Box has forgotten the partridges and races
after puss. But it is difficult for him to make
progress, for the corn is thick and is higher
than the cat’s back. Only with extreme
difficulty is he able to follow the scent.</p>

<p>Grey Puss for the time takes things easily....
She canters quietly away from the
direction of the burial-mound. Several times
she passes ditches and bunches of thistles
where she could easily have lain in ambush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
and attacked the dog; but she knows Box well
enough from old times, and does not take the
pursuit very seriously.</p>

<p>For a time they play hide-and-seek; then
the affair bores her, and she turns and makes
a bee-line for home.</p>

<p>The children, not realizing the state of
affairs, swarm out to meet her.</p>

<p>They see gliding towards them a daylight-coloured
dog with big lumps of night stuck to
its coat. Its legs move very quickly, and its
tail whips and whistles like the wind. It
comes with wide-open jaws, and tongue hanging
out of its mouth. “Ha, ha, ha!” it gasps,
as with half-shut eyes it sniffs eagerly through
its big, split, padded snout.</p>

<p>Box suddenly sees the kittens. He literally
quivers with ferocity; but before he
can reach them the entrance-hole is deserted.</p>

<p>For a long time he remains standing outside,
barking and scratching up the ground—then
he rushes home to the farm and whines
and jumps about; he has something to tell—and
he makes a jump towards the field; he has
seen cats out there, cats of <i>all</i> colours!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Grey Puss pondered a while over the <a id="occurrence"></a>occurrence—this
Box, near whose kennel she used
to sleep, on whose straw she had lain, and
whose food she had sometimes shared, what
did he want here sniffing at their mound?
She could easily understand all the others, her
natural enemies in the fields; but this dog,
who, like she, had once been in favour with
“the cunning ones”—was he friend or was he
foe?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One still, sunny morning she lies by herself
at the edge of a ditch, listening to the cows’
eternal chewing of the cud, when the sound
suddenly ceases.</p>

<p>She wonders why the cows stop eating—and
when, in addition, one or two of them
begin to run about, she puts up her head—and
sees Box lurch out of the corn towards
her....</p>

<p>During the whole of the week she has been
persecuted by the dog and chased about like a
fox. Just as well have it out with him now
as later!</p>

<p>For awhile she retreats before him, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
upon reaching a small mound she sits and
composedly awaits her pursuer.</p>

<p>The plump hooligan, who has lost sight of
his quarry behind the waving grass, comes
along, his nose close to the ground, fully
occupied with following the scent....</p>

<p>So unexpectedly has Grey Puss changed
her tactics that he cannot make up his mind
to stop, but swerves to one side as if about to
run past. She turns as he swings round, thus
keeping her face steadily to the foe....</p>

<p>It is quite a new experience for Box to see
a cat sit and wait to be taken in his jaws.</p>

<p>He prefaces his attack with a volley of
hoarse dog-oaths....</p>

<p>Grey Puss stands with head low and mouth
open; dull thunder rumbles from her throat,
and her tail whips restlessly from side to
side....</p>

<p>Box, who is unfortunate enough to have the
sun full in his eyes, opens his jaws wide and
makes a ferocious snap; which the cat evades
with a high jump which terminates on his
back. Facing backwards on him, she lets fly
with fore and back claws simultaneously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
combing his flesh time after time from neck
to tail.</p>

<p>He howls, and shakes himself, and throws
himself down, and rolls over and over; but
the moment he rises to his feet, Grey Puss is
on his back again.</p>

<p>The ruthless cat-exterminator is driven
almost out of his wits with pain, and rushes
blindly away, burning with lust for revenge,
and raging impotently at such treatment from
a much-despised cat, whom he now tries to
convince in a plaintive whine that he never
meant the slightest harm.</p>

<p>Twice he succeeds in shaking off the vile
she-devil; but she is utterly relentless—and
so, when the old manure-well appears in sight,
he turns there instinctively for help. Without
hesitation he tears at the crazy lid with
his strong, sharp claws—and plunges through
head first, while Grey Puss hops off like the
flick of a whip.</p>

<p>A dull plash follows, and a tall spurt of
red-brown fluid, emitting an insufferable
smell, rises behind him....</p>

<p>Grey Puss sneaks round the opening listening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
to his splashings; then when no more Box
appears, she returns straight home to her
kittens.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_148"></a>THE LIFE-SAVING CHAIR</b>
</h3>

<p>In the evening, when the men were returning
from their work, they heard a miserable
howling and splashing from the old manure-well
in the field. They stopped and listened;
they seemed to know the sound. Wasn’t it
Box’s voice?</p>

<p>One of them went nearer, and saw at once
from the state of the boards that someone had
recently fallen through.</p>

<p>The moment Box heard help approaching,
he began barking loudly. Thanks to his long
stilts, he had, fortunately for him, been able
to reach the bottom; but he could not escape
unaided from the foul cesspool.</p>

<p>The man called to the others, and they hastened
to help the unfortunate bather.</p>

<p>An old fire-hook, attached to a bucket
which was used to hoist manure when the
pump went on strike, was let down, and Box<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
was not long getting into the “life-saving
chair.”</p>

<p>His lacerated and bleeding back was covered
with a generous layer of frightful-smelling
muck; nevertheless, he felt deeply
hurt when his rescuers repulsed his eager,
well-meant thanks for the service they had
rendered him.</p>

<p>“Puh! Box ... you pig!” they shouted,
kicking out at him with their wooden clogs
as he rushed forward to embrace them.</p>

<p>And on arrival at the farm he was, without
the slightest warning, thrice swilled over
with pails of horrid, icy-cold water.</p>

<p>And, to add insult to injury, he was forbidden
admission to the house for several days
afterwards....</p>

<p>After this, “Dirty-pig Box” superseded the
usual call of “Good Box” ... dirty-pig Box
who fell in the cesspit!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Grey Puss is ruler of the fields; no other
animal than Box dare face her claws.</p>

<p>Once there came a fox; but Grey Puss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
settled with him long ago. Prowling about
one night he found the cat-family’s delicious
scent; followed it up to the burial-mound,
and stuck his nose in the entrance ... spitting
and wheezing noises exploded from every
hole and crevice!</p>

<p>When he ventured farther, a claw-speckled
wild beast flew out and slashed at his head
before he had time to bite. He had seen the
spitting fury plainly—but now after the impact
he could not catch a glimpse of it, although
his nose and ears told him plainly that
it was still just in front of him.</p>

<p>Reynard shook his head and blinked his
eyes incessantly, but without effect; he
remained steadily blind. The blood poured
down his face—and in the entrance before
him stood Grey Puss, with back and belly
arched like a tightly strung bow. Her murderous
claws had mutilated her opponent
terribly—both his eyes were torn out....</p>

<p>It would have been a life of idyllic peace
for Grey Puss if only that stupid Box had
kept away....</p>

<p>Her old sweetheart, the kitten’s father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
seldom leaves the shelter of the farm nowadays,
and never ventures as far as the old
willow stumps, let alone the burial-mound.
Besides, the mother-cat no longer has reason
to fear him; he won’t try to eat his children
now that they are so big!</p>

<p>She has long since banished from the fields
the numerous other cats from the village and
the neighbouring farms. The mere sight of
such a sleek, milk-fattened house-cat, who
hunts and kills only for the sport of the thing
rouses a furious hatred in her breast. Besides,
she is just a wee bit jealous of their
sheltered, luxurious lives!</p>

<p>It irritates her that she is forbidden access
to the sweet milk-pails, and that she is homeless,
and doomed to eternal wandering. The
shelter of the barn, the warmth of the stall,
the peaceful gloom of the loft, have never lost
their attraction for her....</p>

<p>During the day she now leaves the kittens
to take care of themselves, and spends most of
her time sleeping under a hedge or fence near
by, lulled by the rustle of the leaves and the
soft rasping of the corn-stalks. At nightfall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
however, she returns regularly to the mound,
bringing always some dainty or other with
her. Then the young ones jump and dance
round her in delight, pulling and biting at
her fur.</p>

<p>But in the depths of the night, some stray
wayfarer, hurrying home with lighted lantern
along the road, sometimes sees a cluster of
fiery balls glowing in the darkness of the
hedge. Two by two they hang, as if fastened
to the wall of gloom....</p>

<p>It is Grey Puss out hunting at the head of
her band of kittens!</p>

<p>She catches hares, so big that she cannot
drag them with her, but must tear them asunder
on the spot and parcel them out among
the youngsters.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_152"></a>THE CROW AGAIN</b>
</h3>

<p>The kittens are now compelled more and
more to find their own food; and in consequence
are often reduced to a very meagre
diet. Maybugs, grasshoppers, and snails
float about inside each of them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>Occasionally, however, the old cat gathers
her flock around her.</p>

<p>When she has made an exceptionally big
catch, which she herself cannot eat up, she
miauws them together for a great banquet.
They behave in exactly the same way as when
they were small kittens: each of them grabs
a lump, and sits down gnawing it, always on
the alert, growling, scowling, and spitting—and,
if necessary, fighting.</p>

<p>Black, especially, has developed extensively
in the matter of quarrelsomeness—and he is
now the terror of his brothers and sisters on
account of his strength and brutality. He
deprives both Grey and Red mercilessly of
their portions; he is not even afraid of letting
Big’s back make the acquaintance of his
claws; which results as a rule in that portion,
also, dropping from its rightful owner’s jaws.</p>

<p>And if his claws do not suffice, his strong,
pointed teeth are brought into play, and infallibly
succeed in convincing his victim that
<i>part</i> of the spoil is not what he is after; he
wants the lot!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Naturally, everyone protests—and as a rule
Big springs at his throat; but when it is a
question of fighting, Black is all there. He
bites hard, and has a habit of following it up
at once with a second bite, if the first does
not take immediate effect.</p>

<p>As a result, he can take whatever liberties
he chooses! One never knows what he will
do next: he tackles things which no ordinary
cat would dream of attempting; all his brothers
and sisters, except Tiny, fight shy of him....
As soon as they see him they shriek out
“Fiew!” And “fiew” is the cat language for
“madness.”</p>

<p>Every morning and evening he takes his
usual walk. Unseen and unheard, he
approaches his quarry, and before the luckless
mouse or bird dreams he is near, he is
upon it with a spring. He never plays with
his victim, but disposes of it at once. Not
until late in the morning does he return home,
for he never goes to rest except on a full
stomach.</p>

<p>Just as Big is the scourge of all birds living
in the field, so is Black the scourge of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
those living in hedge or wood. He wanders
from tree to tree, and not even the densest
thicket can resist his progress. He glides
through the thorny, jealous heart of a hawthorn
copse like a panther, insensate and
invulnerable. Tears in skin or snout please
him and urge him to greater efforts; it is as
if his body cannot feel pain. Black as the
branch itself, he lies stretched at full length,
searching out the little birds’ homes—and
once he catches a glimpse of wings settling
in hiding-place or treetop, he never rests satisfied
until he has made closer, thorough
investigation.</p>

<p>But the old crow defies his strength and
skill. It plays him all manner of tricks, and
uses every imaginable opportunity to bespatter
him with the foulest language.</p>

<p>One day it added to these an unspeakable
insult!</p>

<p>It is early dawn.... All the birds are still
half asleep, and flutter clumsily as they flee
from his path. Even the lark makes such a
din in rising that Black gives quite a jump.</p>

<p>He arrives with a young rat in his mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
at the entrance of the village wood, when
suddenly his old enemy the crow attacks him
in his usual unexpected, disconcerting manner.</p>

<p>He drops the rat for a moment and makes
a foolhardy dash at the bird; but it merely
spreads its wings and, floating leisurely sideways
a short distance, settles on a big
stone....</p>

<p>He would just run over there and shift the
ugly devil!</p>

<p>His temper begins to get the better of him
and he becomes more and more foolhardy;
the rat must look after itself for a bit, while
he gives that beast a real scare for once in its
life! He races like a mad thing after the
bird, from grass tuft to mound, from stone to
stone—and when the cunning old crow has
tempted the inexperienced hot-head far
enough away, it flaps back over his head and
bags the spoil of war.</p>

<p>That <i>was</i> a surprise; nay, more, an event
unparalleled in the black cynic’s whole experience!
His back rises and his hair stands on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
end with fury; but it does not bring back the
young rat from the air.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of all, he felt very
proud of himself. Big-cat could catch birds
and Grey could catch mice; but <i>he</i> could
catch rats....</p>

<p>His short, strong jaws could inflict a terrible
bite—and his teeth gradually became
his most formidable weapon. It seemed almost
as if there were weasel’s blood in him,
so quickly did he fix in his teeth; and he
employed just the animal’s tactics: spring and
bite—and then back out of reach again.</p>

<p>As soon as he found that rats had teeth, he
began to use this method of attack regularly.</p>

<p>Grey Puss often sat looking doubtfully at
him.... No, she was sure he was not quite
cat-normal in the head!</p>

<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_158"></a>THE KITTENS GO OUT HUNTING</b>
</h3>

<p>Grey Puss had not been home for
two whole days and nights.</p>

<p>And the unaided efforts of the
kittens to secure food had not resulted in anything
more satisfying than the usual maybugs
and dragon-flies, with some extra big grasshoppers.</p>

<p>This morning it is such fine day weather
that, after having waited in vain till sunrise
for their mother’s return, they resolve to set
out on a hunting expedition alone. Necessity
is teaching even these four-month-old babies
self-reliance!</p>

<p>They start all together and wind their way
successfully through the corn; they reach a
ditch, and soon after a road—faster and faster
they go....</p>

<p>Big is the leader. Red follows close behind,
ready to help in the event of her brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
being specially lucky. She seconds him carefully;
stops instantly when he stops; crouches
when he crouches. All the time her flame-coloured
eyes sweep round searchingly—and
she wears her most knowing expression.
Farther back comes Grey with her long hare’s
ears thrust forward, her whole attention
directed far ahead. She moves forward in
spasms, sinking down every other moment to
the ground to listen.</p>

<p>A little behind her saunters dreamy little
White; she glances carelessly about her at the
larks, bumble-bees, her sisters ... anything.</p>

<p>Last of all, far behind the rest, looms
“Madness,” shadowed by Tiny—surnamed
“Terror.”</p>

<p>“Terror” has of late risen more and more
in his brother’s estimation; the cunning little
weather-prophet exercises a wonderfully
soothing influence on the ever-angry warrior.
Possibly it is because the little fellow never
with so much as a scowl or an arching of the
back dares to oppose him, but when attacked
instantly rolls over abjectly in the dust.</p>

<p>Black likes the little coward’s companionship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
It is true that he preferred hunting
alone—he was naturally of a solitary disposition
and could not work in a crowd; but, on
the other hand, it was always pleasant to have
someone upon whom to vent his anger when
his hunting was a failure.</p>

<p>The dawn is beginning to break!</p>

<p>Behind a group of long, irregular clouds
which stretch in streaks right across the
heavens, the rising sun’s reflected rays shine
red and gold. But below the clouds all is
darkness, from the depths of which loom the
vague outlines of the immediate foreground.</p>

<p>White daisies twinkle round the thickets
and wallflowers border the rye-field, while
snakeweed and cornflowers shine forth along
hedge and path.</p>

<p>A little reed-warbler gives a voice to a hole
in the swamp and sings and trills in thin
staccato. The sight of an insect causes it
simultaneously to increase its volume of sound
and to curve upwards from the ground. For
a moment it hangs with outspread wings
motionless in the air—then sinks slowly and
gracefully, singing all the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>White watches the bird’s movements lazily;
her interest is so small that her tail-tip
scarcely curls.</p>

<p>The fly is not captured, nor was that really
the little songster’s intention.... The insect
had merely roused its desire to leave its
gloomy hole and climb up into the fresh air
and sunshine.</p>

<p>But now partridges begin to lend the fields
voices; yellow-hammers twitter in the hedges;
starlings in the village wood; linnets in the
depths of the hawthorn thicket.</p>

<p>In a patch of weeds near one of the swamps
a sucking-calf wakes from its slumber. It
has a skin like a lion and a pair of glittering-black,
leopard’s eyes; but in other respects
could not possibly be mistaken for a beast of
prey. Although they have never seen such a
creature before, the kittens practically ignore
it; except for White, who feels enormously
attracted the moment she catches a whiff of
the sweet cow-smell.</p>

<p>The calf is still so feeble that it cannot
stand upon its legs. Its eyes follow the small
white visitor languidly, as the kitten with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
arched back and rigid tail rubs herself affectionately
against its neck.</p>

<p>White delights in the warm animal-odour
which streams in over her; closer and closer
she presses herself against the calf, miauwing
all the while coyly and ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>The flies assemble in multitude on the baby
calf’s wrinkled, red skin; White catches a
score of them with ease, and thereby satisfies
her appetite; then, discovering a thick layer
of milk scum on her host’s muzzle, she cautiously
licks that off too. Finally she curls
herself up between the animal’s legs and goes
to sleep.</p>

<p>The others continue hunting....</p>

<p>Scattered about at irregular intervals in
the form of a fan, they spread themselves out
over the landscape.</p>

<p>On arriving at a wheat-field bordering the
little village copse, Big and the thief-cat find
fresh human “spoor” on a narrow, winding
path. Anything human repels Big—but Red
follows them up towards the farm.... Suddenly
a flock of sparrows buzz out from a
hedge and settle in the wheat. A thrill runs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
through Big; his eyes gleam with the lust
of the chase—and he follows noiselessly in
their wake.</p>

<p>Grey has long ago heard the squeak of a
mouse in the hedge, and found an inhabited
mouse-hole near which he sits in ambush.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_163"></a>THE ATTACK ON THE CROW’S NEST</b>
</h3>

<p>Black, shadowed by “Terror,” walks
straight towards the village copse; a little
wilderness of elms and ashes, with a thick
undergrowth of nettles, meadow-sweet, and
buttercups. A flower-bedecked box-thorn
hedge guides them from the fields into the
twisting wood-scented tunnels, where a subdued
greenish glimmer succeeds the strong
white light of the meadow.</p>

<p>From a poplar over in the corner are heard
gurglings and flutterings; the young crows,
already big and able to fly, are receiving
their first beakful of breakfast.</p>

<p>Black and Tiny sit down and listen eagerly....
Suddenly an old she-hare, homeward
bound, comes running along the path towards
them. At the sight of the giant animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
“Terror” rushes off into hiding, but Black
puts on his war-paint and stands his ground:
he raises his back and shows his teeth, hoists
his tail and erects a stiff bulwark of “brushes”
all over him.</p>

<p>The hare stamps his forefoot on the ground;
then vanishes like the wind.</p>

<p>Before Black has quite recovered from this
shock he gets another: his enemy the old crow
has spotted him, and hangs poised in the treetop.</p>

<p>A horrid red-green haze overspreads
“Madness’” eyes; he shakes and quivers all
over his body each time the bird utters its
loud, grating cry.</p>

<p>He <i>hates</i> that crow! His skill in climbing;
his courage in attack; his swiftness of
spring; are useless against it. Noisy and
bragging, conscious of its enemy’s powerlessness,
it balances high up in the air, shouting
to the whole world that he, the cat, is about,
that he is on the warpath!</p>

<p>Black’s whiskers quiver; he growls with
suppressed savagery and passion.... How
he would like to catch that crow; torture it,
eat it—eat it very slowly!...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Now he slips into hiding in a burdock
clump and waits patiently for the squalling
devil’s curiosity to subside.</p>

<p>A blackbird whistles from a willow and a
magpie warbles from the copse; he follows
carefully by means of sounds what is happening
... and when all is quiet again, he
sneaks on once more—with his faithful
follower at his tail-end.</p>

<p>A strong, earthy smell mingled with the
scent of flowers fills the tunnels. The two
cats have constant difficulty in breathing, and
again make towards the outskirts of the copse.</p>

<p>“Madness” is already making for the
boundary-hedge when he suddenly sees a
young crow, with something heavy in its beak,
flap into the top of an elder tree. His glance
grows as black as a thunder-cloud—and without
a second’s hesitation he leaps back from
the hawthorn and gallops to the tree.</p>

<p>“Terror” patters in his wake ... until he
reaches the root of the elder, where he sits up
on his hind legs and watches the ascent.</p>

<p>Black climbs rapidly with short, agile
springs. When he is half-way up the young
crow flies away to another treetop....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Black tries to follow by means of the lateral
branches, but finding none of these strong
enough to bear, he is compelled to descend to
the bottom and begin all over again at the
next tree.</p>

<p>The pursuit is carried on noiselessly. The
bird has no suspicion that it is being pursued;
otherwise its wild war-cry would begin instantly.</p>

<p>The elders are half grown and rather
difficult to climb. Nevertheless, the cat’s
zeal is unabated; although he has soon cantered
up and down three of them—but then,
trees are for him nothing more formidable
than extra steep hills.</p>

<p>In the fourth elder he gives up, and hangs
panting, with claws anchored in the stem—while
brother Tiny waits below, wildly
excited as to the result of the expedition.</p>

<p>Very often whilst waiting in this same manner
“Terror” has received his—in <i>his</i> opinion—well-earned
reward in the shape of a
dropped egg; or a wretched fledgling bird,
which, horrified by the sight of the two evil,
greedy eyes rising over the side of the nest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
has flapped vainly into space on its half-formed
wings, leaving Black to devour its
helpless brothers and sisters. All such windfalls
Tiny takes as thank-offerings from his
big brother and promptly puts them out of
sight....</p>

<p>Was dear old “Madness” about to make
another haul? The poltroon knows well that
in any case there is nothing to do but sit and
wait!</p>

<p>Whilst doing so, he dares not for his life
make a sound—not the least hint of a
“miauw!” Once, long ago, he did so—the
next moment “Madness” left his ambush and
fell on him tooth and nail. Tiny supposed at
first that he was being attacked in mistake for
the quarry. Would he be eaten? But no,
he should only keep his mouth shut!</p>

<p>After a long “breather,” the climber unclamps
himself and resumes his progress
through the treetops. He comes soon to a
place where the trees stand extra close together,
so that Tiny constantly receives twigs
and bits of bark in his face. Under this treatment
the little rogue’s keenness gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
diminishes—nothing good to eat comes down!</p>

<p>By chance Black stumbles on the tree where
the crow’s nest is situated. Walking along a
cross branch he lowers himself into it. It is
beautifully soft and comfortable—but, alas!
long since empty. A good idea strikes him
... the sunshine is so gloriously warm up
here ... why not take his midday nap in the
nest!</p>

<p>He lies down and, shutting his eyes, falls
into a half-doze, without taking the slightest
regard for Tiny, who sits patiently waiting
below. Comfortably rolled up on his side, his
nose thrust between his thighs, he is wafted
dreamily through space.</p>

<p>The sun goes gratefully down, saturating his
coat with warmth and filling his mind and
body with content. The rushing of the wind
and the sighing of the long curved branches
add to the sensuous enjoyment of his slumber....</p>

<p>He has always loved thus to swing and
sway. At home at the burial-mound his
favourite position is right at the very top
of the little, wind-blown poplar. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
occasions when he has quarrelled with all the
rest he likes to creep up there, and sit like a
marten, with his paws drawn well in under
him. For hours at a time he sits there with
wrinkled scruff and half-shut eyes, enjoying
the view out over the undulating land. At
long intervals he lowers his head and peeps
solemnly down, like an owl waking from
sleep.</p>

<p>“Terror” finds the wait endless!</p>

<p>And the only explanation he can think of
for his brother’s lengthy residence above is
that he has found something exceptionally
good. “Terror’s” large, wondering eyes sparkle
with anticipation and excitement ... at
the worst he is sure to get a few bones or
feathers!</p>

<p>He keeps scratching his claws impatiently
on the tree-trunk; attempts also to clamber up,
but soon gives it up as hopeless.</p>

<p>Suddenly his spine tingles with fear; he
hears the old crow’s hateful, angry shout—he
scurries away and hides in the cornfield.</p>

<p>Black, also, jumps up hurriedly. He leaps
out of the nest and clings to the trunk beneath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
while with flattened ears he peers scowlingly
into the air....</p>

<p>Yes, there is the beast, hanging above him
with its black wings outstretched. It opens
its beak and shrieks mockingly down at him.
It’s black, glittering eyes follow him viciously,
totally unabashed by his own raging, murderous
glare.</p>

<p>“Madness” reaches a difficult fork in the
tree and hesitates....</p>

<p>The crow instantly seizes the opportunity!</p>

<p>Conscious of its superiority in the air, it
hurtles down upon him. The cunning bird
has long ago noticed that Black is an earthbound
animal—and now he has been so foolhardy
as to leave the ground and venture up
into his opponent’s hunting-ground—yes, into
its very nest—he should soon be made to regret
his insolence!</p>

<p>The old crow is also strongly influenced by
the prospect of an easy victory and a good
feast afterwards. With all its might it fastens
its claws in the black cat’s shoulder.</p>

<p>The shock shakes Black from the fork, but
he does not lose his balance; he just slides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
down backwards until he reaches an out-jutting
branch. Clinging to this with his forepaws,
he uses his back legs to such good effect,
that the crow is forced to let go his hold.</p>

<p>The kitten feels no fear; on the contrary, he
is filled with hate. The fury of madness
flames in his eyes, and a white scum begins to
froth round his mouth.</p>

<p>The crow sits just before him on the branch,
making vicious pecks at his nose and eyes in
the hope of overbalancing him. Suddenly
Black gathers his back legs beneath him and,
in the same moment that his enemy makes a
fresh dart at him, launches himself forward.</p>

<p>The old crow is swept helplessly backwards
by the reckless fury of the assault. The next
moment they are both whirling through the
air towards the ground.</p>

<p>Black, however, knows nothing of <a id="this"></a>this. He
is utterly engrossed in the large, warm piece
of meat, into which he now plunges his hind
claws also, biting and tearing all the while at
the bird’s neck-feathers with his short, pointed
teeth.</p>

<p>They crash to the earth ... but continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
fighting with unabated fury, wrestling and
rolling over and over, feathers and fur-tufts
flying in all directions.</p>

<p>The crow caws hoarsely, and struggles to
break away from the kitten, whose fighting
prowess it has so disastrously underestimated.</p>

<p>With widespread tail-feathers and frantically
flapping wings it tries in vain to regain
its feet, and shake off its maddened little
opponent. It bites and pecks unceasingly at
Black’s fur, aiming cunningly at the soft
places; for it knows by instinct the cat’s most
vulnerable points—eyes and nose.</p>

<p>But Black does not budge until the last
breath is squeezed from the crow’s lifeless
body.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Madness,” having killed his foe, straight-way
sits down and begins gnawing its head.
At the sound of the crunching several of the
other kittens, who have watched terror-stricken
the great black clump flutter through
the air, understand at last the nature of the
situation.</p>

<p>Big rushes to the spot with giant leaps;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Grey sneaks cautiously after and springs upon
the spoil, as if she herself had made the coup.
“Terror” swaggers from his hiding-place and
fixes his teeth in a wing, the toughness of
which almost shakes his conviction that he is
the very devil of a fellow!</p>

<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_174"></a>THE CANARY</b>
</h3>

<p>Round the outskirts of the farm the
wallflowers crowd in full bloom,
flaming and glowing in the nearly
risen sun.</p>

<p>A little fox-coloured cat curls in and out
among the flowers, sniffing the yellow goose-grass
and the purple thyme. With its own
inimitable deftness it avoids the dew.</p>

<p>It follows a human “spoor,” the pursuit of
which its big brother has long since abandoned
on account of its acid smell.</p>

<p>Red reaches a garden; she enters—and now
she scents spoor after spoor, all of which lead
along the hedge towards a heap of branches,
where they stand still for a long time.</p>

<p>She makes, as usual, a thorough investigation,
sniffing each single stone and leaf; but
this time she is unlucky, and fails to remark a
little grey-brown partridge, which now, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
the third year in succession, hatches its eggs
under the branches on the opposite side of the
hedge.</p>

<p>Here, in the leafy soil, the bird has formed
its nest. The maid had found it one day when
hoeing the weeds from the path, and now she
goes there every day to look after her bird.</p>

<p>The ceaseless, soothing rustle of the poplar-leaves
and the hollow, satisfied purring of the
rye filter through the hedge and distract the
scavenger’s attention. Then she surprises a
dragon-fly with the morning dew still on its
wings....</p>

<p>Suddenly a burst of chirping and whistling
streams out from an open window: a bright yellow
canary hops joyfully in its wire-bound
cage.</p>

<p>Not a single “human” to be seen or heard!
Red leaves the dragon-fly to work out its own
salvation and wriggles like a worm towards
the unsuspecting bird.</p>

<p>But how can she capture it?</p>

<p>Ah, that is <i>her</i> specialty! Out in the wilds
she fails time after time; she is not quick
enough, not bold enough, not sure enough!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
She does not understand how to <i>work</i>; but she
is a genius at thieving!</p>

<p>The fear of detection stimulates her special
powers and characteristics to an incredible degree.
During these brief periods she becomes
far more cunning and far more ferocious than
any of the other kittens.</p>

<p>If only the bird could fly up and away—she
would be foiled at once! Or if it could only
keep calm and remain sitting in the middle of
its perch in its safe, wire-bound cage—all her
efforts would be useless.</p>

<p>But the terrified canary begins to flutter
about wildly—and Red’s tactics make her still
more confused.</p>

<p>The cat keeps jumping from one side to the
other; and then up on the top of the cage and
down again....</p>

<p>The more maddened and confused the poor
bird becomes, the calmer and more composed
is the cat. With cold-blooded precision she
waits until her victim comes within reach,
then thrusts her strong paw against the cage.
The thin wires separate, and through the
aperture her scythe-like claws impale the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
canary and haul it towards her. One mouthful
and it is gone!</p>

<p>Now for flight....</p>

<p>Like a streak of sunlight she glides along
the window-sill and leaps to the ground—while
sparrows from the gutter fight for the
yellow feather, which the warm summer
breeze loosens from her whiskers and bears
aloft.</p>

<p>Once in the garden she gets up speed,
scurries along the hedge, through into the
cornfield, and so along the hedge again.</p>

<p>But why run? No shout or bark breaks
the silence ... it does not look as if mankind’s
four-legged police have seen her this
time!</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_177"></a>BOX AND THE RED COMMUNIST</b>
</h3>

<p>Red became more and more reckless—and
the wretched Box, who often saw her from his
kennel, suffered the agonies of Tantalus!</p>

<p>His defeat in the manure-well had not reformed
the cat-nihilist. He was still in the
mood for war, and bent upon taking a bloody
revenge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>For two whole weeks he has been chained
up—but now the farmer’s wife herself resolved
to take him in hand. His constant
assaults on all cats, and especially his occasional
outbreaks on her own, have for a long
time given her great annoyance.</p>

<p>Every day he spends several hours sitting in
a basket of hay in the kitchen together with
five little newly-born kittens, which crawl
squeaking round his legs and body. By this
treatment they hope to make him accustomed
to cats!</p>

<p>He is watched very closely; the slightest
suspicious movement on his part brings a
crack on the head from ladle or poker. The
little ones also treat him with the utmost disrespect:
they hiss at him and spit right in his
face!</p>

<p>When the “lesson” is over for the day and
he is shut out of the kitchen, his sensitive mind
is in such a turmoil that he scarcely knows
what he is doing. The most weird things
happen: he sees cats everywhere—the sun itself
turns into a huge, shining cat-face—and
with hair on end and tail between his legs he
makes a frantic charge towards it....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>One day just after his lesson Box meets a
little red cat-devil out in the garden with an
eel-skin in its mouth.</p>

<p>Black cats and grey cats were bad enough—but
<i>red</i> cats turned him into a raving maniac!</p>

<p>He chases after the thief, who makes for the
rye-field. The cheeky little red-skin does not
trouble to abandon her “catch,” and even has
the sangfroid to stop in her flight to dig it
down!</p>

<p>The delay was almost fatal—and had she
not been lucky enough, when crossing a strip
of fallow ground on her way to the cornfield,
to run across Grey Puss, who was stalking
young peewits, there is little doubt as to how
things would have ended.</p>

<p>The old she-cat, realizing the state of affairs,
unhesitatingly takes her kitten’s place.
She runs right across Box’s nose and inveigles
him after her into the cornfield. To do battle
in the open is not her intention at all; she
knows far subtler tactics!</p>

<p>Once among the corn, she quickly contrives
to lose sight of the dog; and then lies down in
ambush, waiting an opportunity to attack in
the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>Box is not smart enough to suspect her design.
Feeling, as always, that he is the undisputed
lord of the fields, he rushes about
barking angrily and aggressively. Matters
are taking their usual course, he thinks!</p>

<p>That devil of a cat has of course hidden
herself somewhere, and imagines <i>his</i> nose cannot
find her—as if a cat were not the simplest
of all creatures to track down.... Why,
every straw touched by a cat simply stank!</p>

<p>Box is easy to deceive, and runs right into
the trap set for him by the little field tiger.</p>

<p>He has not the slightest idea how it happened—but
this he <i>knows</i>: that the clawed
she-devil is sitting on his back again, and is
already tearing his skin to shreds.</p>

<p>His howls are so loud, and Grey Puss’
growls so deep and threatening, that they are
heard at the burial-mound. The kittens start
up from their day-doze and, fully understanding
what is taking place, begin to strut about
with stiff legs and erect tails, uttering little
half-growls at intervals. “Madness” goes one
better: he makes off through the corn towards
the scene of action....</p>

<p>He is a real little cat-sportsman!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_181"></a>THE SMOKE-DOG</b>
</h3>

<p>The nihilist was really beginning to reform.
What the farmer’s wife failed to achieve with
her dog lessons, Grey Puss succeeded in doing
with her needle-like claws.</p>

<p>But Box had his allies!</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon, when the farm
hands felt the time hang heavily, one of them
suggested a visit to the burial-mound. Box
was always running out there and barking at
something—probably there was a fox in the
hole.</p>

<p>To be prepared for emergencies, one of the
men snatched up an armful of hay, and off
they went, the dog dancing excitedly in front.
Box, who understood at once what was on foot,
felt fearfully important—and the moment the
mound came in sight he set up a mighty war-cry;
and by so doing gave the kittens plenty
of warning.</p>

<p>For a long time the inhabitants of the
mound lay listening to the loud barking; then
they heard the dull tramp of “humans,” and
a little later the crackling of hay—and now a
huge, foul-smelling creature entered the tunnel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>Slowly and silently it crept forward; dirty
and grey, it swayed and swelled; soon it completely
filled the passage.</p>

<p>Grey Puss growled threateningly and
crouched low on the ground, her face towards
the oncoming monster. Big-kitten lay at her
side, ready to lend instant assistance; while
“Madness” hissed and bared his teeth, prepared
to fight to the death.</p>

<p>He had fought with moles, with rats, and
even with a crow—but never with an opponent
which stared so keenly back as this one.
Although he could not see its eyes in the
gloom, the smoke-dog’s glare made his own
smart until they watered, so that he had to
keep wiping them dry with his forepaw.</p>

<p>Now the mysterious beast was upon them!
“Madness” saw his mother spring to her feet—and
he rushed valiantly towards the enemy,
his mouth opened wide to seize it by the
throat. Instead, he himself was seized by the
throat! He had to open his mouth still
wider; he felt as if his tongue were being torn
out; he coughed and spluttered; a suffocating
feeling racked his nose; he could not draw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
breath; his nostrils pricked and smarted as if
clutched by the monster’s invisible claws.
Snorting and sneezing, he turned and fled <a id="for"></a>for
his life.</p>

<p>He has managed to escape; luckily the monster
could not hold him! Also, it does not
drive him to frenzy, like that confounded old
crow, by jabbing at his tender whiskers all the
time. It is more merciful, and allows him to
retreat in peace.</p>

<p>He regains his breath and is almost himself
again. He rubs his head well with both forepaws
and prepares for another attack. This
time he is <i>determined</i> not to run away—and he
shakes his head up and down to see where he
is.</p>

<p>Fortunately for little “Madness” as well as
for “Terror,” who together with Grey and
White lay crouched in a corner of the tomb,
their eyes flashing green with fright ... fortunately
indeed for the whole happy family,
the “smoke-dog” abruptly ceased barking its
stinking breath down towards them.</p>

<p>The bundle of hay brought by the labourers
was consumed. They could have procured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
more easily enough—for there was plenty of
corn round the hill, and it lay in sheaves—but
they had found out by now that smoke was
there in abundance—what was lacking was a
draught to carry the smoke down into the hole.</p>

<p>And besides, what if they did manage to
suffocate the beast—they would never be able
to get it out and skin it; so that there would be
no pelt to make an odd shilling or two out of!
What was the <i>use</i> of it all?</p>

<p>Well, after all, they had killed time for a
couple of hours ... and they threw themselves
on their backs and began to play with
Box, stroking his back and ears. Yes, he was
a fine dog! “Here, Box, Box!”—and they
smacked their trouser-legs—“seize cat, seize
cat!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That day was the last the kittens spent in the
old viking-grave!</p>

<p>Just as once before in their lives Grey Puss
had rescued them from the willow stump, so
did she rescue them now from the burial-mound.</p>

<p>This time it was so simple! They knew all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
about it in advance—and she had only to place
herself at their head and lead on....</p>

<p>They left the Hill Farm’s fertile fields, and
crossed right over to the other side of the village.
There, near a disused peat-pit, they
found a dilapidated turf-house, in the deserted
loft of which they made their home.</p>

<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_186"></a>THE BEST CAT</b>
</h3>

<p>Big-cat knew the neighbourhood thoroughly
for a distance of at least two
miles in every direction.</p>

<p>Along fence and ditch, which were his
hunting-paths, he crept in search of his
prey....</p>

<p>Then he disappeared in a cornfield, and
commenced his laborious stalking operations,
the thick forest of corn-stalks making constant
demands on his skill.</p>

<p>The green, brown-jointed stems stood
quivering and swaying in the wind; their
withered, rust-spotted leaf-tips scratched his
nose and poked him in the eyes, while inflicting
constant torture to his soft, sensitive
moustache. But once in the field he was unmindful
of such trifles, and with noiseless
steps he stole along utterly absorbed, like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
true sportsman he was, in the breathless exaltation
of the chase.</p>

<p>He was alone with Nature ... and in his
ears sounded her unique harmonies: the
swishing of the wind through the poplar-top—that
full, rich music with its sharp undertone
which could only be fully appreciated
by senses as finely attuned as his—and the
thin, eternal seething of the barley or the rattling
of the oats, were to him the earth’s song
of love; he was its best cat, its greatest and
happiest hunter!</p>

<p>He felt in touch with Nature; inspired by
her music to great deeds.... Tiny red ladybirds
with black-spotted body-shields wandered
up and down the corn; and when he
stopped to think, or to peer ahead through
the waving green multitude of straws, he
could see the little red fox-tongue of the
poppy and the rough-haired cornflower’s deep
blue snake’s-eyes. At intervals the white
marguerite flashed like a lark’s breast momentarily
into view, fixing his gaze for one
fleeting moment with hypnotic attraction.</p>

<p>The depths of the corn vibrated with mystery....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Sounds which lived and died before
he could guess their maker, thronged
his ears on every side! <i>Uncanny</i> things happened
out here in the jungle of the summer
corn—he felt sure of it!</p>

<p>A sudden rustling followed by a crashing
retreat sounds in front of him; it is the corn
shrieking under the foot of a fleeting hare!
Presently a loud turmoil in the air breaks for
the moment Nature’s harmonious melody: he
starts up, and the nervous twitching of his
whiskers betrays his overwrought condition;
soon he hears the warning call of an approaching
partridge—and now he recognizes the
noise, and sits down again while his sensitive
nerve-strings gradually resume their normal
vibration.</p>

<p>Finally, when a long-legged frog, panic-stricken
at his approach, leaps with its cold
body right into his face, he has, fortunately,
recovered from his previous shock, and continues
calmly on his way.</p>

<p>A large flock of tame pigeons from the
farm sweep past just overhead, bringing a
glow to his eyes. Soon afterwards he hears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the flap of their wings as they land among the
peas. In the flock are white, red, and blue
pigeons....</p>

<p>His body sinks to the ground. Now is
the chance to prove that he is a born master-hunter.
He feels his pulse hammer and his
heart thump!</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour’s stalking he
pokes his head out of a heap of cut-down
peas. He is panting for breath with a half-open
mouth, and his eyes shine with a greenish
light. His muscles are tense to the uttermost—the
great thing now is not to surrender
to his exhaustion and so spoil everything he
has already done....</p>

<p>The pigeons rise and float round in a circle—a
habit they have—and the next moment a
dazzling white turbit flaps within reach.</p>

<p>No need for him to spring; he just lashes
out and hooks three of his curved claws into
its breast! The claws go in easily enough;
but they will not come out again so willingly!
In fact, the more frantically the victim struggles
to get loose, the more firmly his nails
seem to hold; they literally stick to everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
they touch. Now his jaws flash forward
with their strong muscles—and the pigeon
gives up the ghost at the first bite!</p>

<p>With the spoil in his mouth Big-cat retires
hurriedly into a recess between two burdock
plants; here he devours his catch.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_190"></a>“MADNESS” AND THE OWL</b>
</h3>

<p>In the evening it is brother Black’s turn!</p>

<p>Reckless as “Madness” was in the daytime,
it was nothing to what he became when darkness
fell. The moment the sun had set, his
claws itched to be out on the warpath....</p>

<p>At first he captured maybugs and grasshoppers;
but when the darkness began to
gather he prepared for serious work. From
the top of the turf-house roof or from the
brow of some hill he peered out over the landscape,
listening: were there “humans” or dogs
about?</p>

<p>Worming and creeping between molehills
and grass-stems he made his way, stopping at
frequent intervals to look round or listen.
Where did the lark go to bed? Where did
the partridges assemble? He was not in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
least afraid of weasels and stoats; he let fly
at them with his claws, spitting and hissing....</p>

<p>One night when the sky is lowering and
the clouds are scudding he goes out as usual.
He moves along on his soft, noiseless paws
like a part of the silent darkness itself. The
owl over in the village copse hoots hideously,
making other creatures rush into hiding; but
Black does not hide; the sound makes his
blood rage!</p>

<p>He steals into the copse, choosing the leafless
places near the boundary hedge and along
the paths. “Ow!” Now he will be quite
lame and crippled; for he is compelled to
remain motionless and silent at the very moment
he steps on a sharp-pointed stone.</p>

<p>The next second he is crouching flat on the
ground, his ears directed ahead.... Something
is moving in front of him!</p>

<p>Oh, it is only the little baby hare which
he has seen several times already! It gambols
round him—until the owl dives out of
the darkness and blots out the hare with its
black wings. Then it utters that diabolical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
shriek again. Black goes mad; it calls to
him, he feels; it <i>pulls</i> him ... and he hurls
himself forward—to be reduced to sheer spitting
and spluttering at the sight that confronts
him.</p>

<p>A cat like himself, but with feathers and
wings, rolls a beaked head forward out of the
bundle before him! It hoots mournfully, like
the wind sighing among the giant stones—and
tears his nose with its claws....</p>

<p>Black, also, blows himself out and glares
fiercely at the enemy, while his tail whips
restlessly to and fro. He is suddenly a <i>cat of
nine tails</i> standing there! What is more, his
body does not stand on all fours; only the
two hind legs and the left forepaw bear its
weight—his right forepaw is, as usual, slightly
raised ready for his lightning spring!</p>

<p>Then his face twists sideways, and he
intones the war-chant which he has inherited
from his father: “Auw-auw-auw—o-o-o—ttt!”</p>

<p>Can he capture spoil by hanging back and
hesitating? Can he gain meat by being
afraid and running away?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>His thoughts drive him to frenzy!</p>

<p>He flies at the owl, and transfixes one of
its ears. He attacks again—and the flying
cat decides that things are getting too warm.
It swings itself up to a branch and begins also
to wail its war-cry:</p>

<p>“Auw-auw-auw....”</p>

<p>“Oo-oo-hoo-oo....”</p>

<p>“Tt-ttt....”</p>

<p>During the pauses Black devours the best
parts of the hare.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_193"></a>THE HANGER-ON</b>
</h3>

<p>Black is a fighter: brave, daring, sometimes
foolhardy; but “Terror” is, and always
will be, a hanger-on.</p>

<p>When all danger is past, and the owl has
flown away, he sneaks forward and receives
his usual share of the booty. He assists the
angry warrior in every possible manner: licks
his wounds, rubs him dry, and offers him his
stomach as a nose-warmer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the little fellow, he does
not understand in the least how to profit by
the talents bestowed on him by Mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Nature; neither as humorist nor as weather-prophet
can he earn his daily bread.</p>

<p>All the more desperately, therefore, he
clings to his brother; seeking, by means of
constant vigilance and servility, to make himself
indispensable to the fighter.</p>

<p>A few days later they are both lying asleep
under a hedge, when “Terror” hears a twittering
and sits up. Raising his head, he peeps
cautiously out over the grass, and sees a blackbird
catching worms on the turf.</p>

<p>Just then another blackbird joins the first,
forcing Tiny to duck down hurriedly.</p>

<p>While still in his hiding-place, he turns
his head slowly to one side, pushing his ears
at the same time, if possible, still farther forward.
The slightest movement, he knows, is
dangerous if done openly....</p>

<p>Now he is ready to let his yellow orbs, like
twin searchlights, sweep in a new direction;
again he sticks up his head.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” He almost jumps with joy at
the sight that meets his eyes. The freshly
harvested pea-field before him is literally
carpeted with small hedge-sparrows! Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
how his heart beats! He can feel its ticking
in every toe-tip ... small hedge-sparrows,
the best of all! Um-m-m!</p>

<p>His sinews twist and stretch in sympathy
with his mental exaltation, and his coat bulges
with his expanding muscles.... Blackbirds
on one hand, sparrows on the other—and now
a little dike-chat just overhead! He can’t
resist craning his neck to watch the little
dear.... How his stalking qualities are
being tested to-day!</p>

<p>But it is too big a job for “Terror”; he
must wake Black—and he touches the slumbering
god gingerly with his paw.</p>

<p><a id="quote"></a>“Madness” laboriously raises one sleep-laden
eyelid; and at first is inclined to thrash
the other for his supposed clumsiness. But
upon catching sight of his assistant’s strained
expression he understands that something
good to eat must be in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He jumps up and looks round.</p>

<p>Then, to Tiny’s almost tearful amazement
and disappointment, the great man, instead
of holding a council of war, curls up again
and goes to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>Black is an old hand; he knows that birds
are best stalked after dark!</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_196"></a>GREY ON THE WARPATH</b>
</h3>

<p>Over hill and dale as far as the eye can
reach stretch line after line of stacked-up
corn-sheaves. The golden oats and the light-yellow
barley and wheat, have fallen asleep
at last—heavy and listless under the clear,
blue harvest sky. The spring’s soft call to
growth and love, the summer’s vibrant note
of lust and passion, have worked their will
and ripened every ear. Out here in the
fields, in Nature’s sun-baked forcing-house,
are none—<i>none</i> who have not found and
drunk to its dregs the strong, sweet wine of
fruitful life. They have sprung into being,
grown up, fructified—now they bring forth
their seed and yield themselves to fate....</p>

<p>One sunny afternoon, while the spiders
spin their webs and the pimpernels blink
their little red flowers, Grey sets out hunting
through the rye stubble.</p>

<p>Suddenly she hears the squeak of a mouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
from a heap of rakings—and becomes instantly
stiff and rigid, her ears forward and
tail bent.</p>

<p>The mice are indeed holding a feast in the
rakings; the company is joyous and boisterous
at the sight of such a good spread.</p>

<p>With shining eyes Grey cautiously lifts her
forepaw and moves it slowly, very slowly,
forward; silently she puts it down on the
ground—and now she brings her back leg
forward too, raising it high in the air to avoid
the stubble. But just as she is about to put
it down, the mice become suddenly silent—and
she has to remain for a long time in her
uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>At last the happy squeaking begins again—and
Grey completes her step and commences
a fresh one.</p>

<p>It takes her a whole quarter of an hour to
move two yards; but to her it seems no longer
than a minute.</p>

<p>When stalking, she falls into the most extraordinary
attitudes: she crooks her back,
stretches forward her neck, and curls like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
bed of a stream round stray stones and loose
ears of corn; but at last she is so close that the
mouse-feast is directly under her nose.</p>

<p>Noiselessly she leaps forward ... plunges
into the heap of straw; makes one swift, fatal
stroke with her forepaw—and pulls out a
small, earth-coloured mouse, which she puts
straight into her mouth.</p>

<p>As she walked away she felt and looked
very proud of her victory. True, she would
have liked to torture her victim; but she had
been too ravenous to wait!</p>

<p>It was soon an everyday event for Grey to
capture a mouse! She, the little, short-legged,
big-eared kitten, who was herself
rather like a big rat, had become indeed the
terror of the small nibblers.</p>

<p>But she had another string to her bow!</p>

<p>For hours she would lie in wait by the side
of the big bog-pool, and fish the gleaming
shell-fish out of the water with lightning
strokes of her paw. Regularly in the early
morning she would creep down to the pond,
and sit on the extreme edge, without paying
the least attention to the splashing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
small waves. On one occasion she even
plunged head first into the water—and came
up again with a large, wriggling carp in her
mouth.</p>

<p>She was not only a mouse-cat, but a fish-cat
too!</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_199"></a>THE THIEF-CAT</b>
</h3>

<p>While the others sneaked round in copse
and cornfield, following their crooked, winding
hunting-paths, Red-kitten usually made
a bee-line to the nearest house or farm.
Sometimes, at rare intervals, she ventured
into the village itself. She liked best to
approach by means of the high road and the
path through the churchyard ... but it had
to be very late at night, when it was quite
dark!</p>

<p>In broad daylight she preferred keeping
under cover as much as possible, and following
cattle-paths, wheel-tracks, and ditches.
The nearer she approached to the village, the
shorter and slower became her steps—until
at last she sat down to consider matters and
spy out the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>She was cautious almost to absurdity; but
caution as well as courage were necessary if
she were to succeed. She knew that the
village bristled with obstacles: dogs by the
dozen to chase her, and other cats who would
bar her progress from sheer evil nature and
jealousy. But life is full of such worries!</p>

<p>She had developed a taste for “kitchen-game”:
roast herring and lumps of eel, boiled
meat and delicious-smelling ham! She found
that kind of thing much easier to capture
than mice or birds. She regarded cream,
especially, as a great delicacy—and her red-striped
coat could therefore often be seen
where this brand of “kitchen-game” lay in
hiding.</p>

<p>The bailiff kept a sharp lookout for her.
Once he kept watch the whole day from
morning till evening outside his back door,
where an old, dilapidated meat-safe of his
had recently been plundered. In it lay a
freshly roasted pork chop, the smell of which
he hoped would attract the thief.</p>

<p>About noon, however, the bailiff became
hungry and went indoors to refresh himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
after his morning’s tedious exertions—and
when he came out again half an hour later to
resume his watch, he was just in time to see
the “red devil” vanish through the garden
with the pork chop in <a id="her"></a>her jaws.</p>

<p>Red had scented the “kitchen-bird” in its
cage on the wall and had broken her way in;
well for her that she had heard the footsteps
in time....</p>

<p>Whenever she found anything that suited
her fancy she took it at once. To do otherwise,
it seemed to her, would be stupidity—and
of <i>stupidity</i> no one had yet accused the
thief-cat!</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_201"></a>WHITE-KITTEN AND THE CALF</b>
</h3>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the pool also,
where the red baby calf was tethered, autumn
began to wave its withered hand. The great
burdock plants were dying of consumption;
their huge flat leaves were faded and contracted.
When White brushed against them
in passing, they crackled irritably.</p>

<p>White-kitten came down almost daily to
the pool; the little red ruminant and she became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
quite friendly after a while. They
rubbed noses together and galloped away at
full speed, the calf in front with its stiff,
clumsy hops, and White just behind.</p>

<p>One day, as the calf rose to its feet, the
kitten seized hold of the tuft at the end of its
tail and let herself be dragged some distance
along the ground.</p>

<p>After that, “joy-rides” at the end of the
calf’s tail became one of her greatest delights.</p>

<p>She knew exactly when the calf’s owner—the
small farmer from the cottage by the side
of the bog—came out with the milk-pail; but
she had not yet summoned up courage to greet
him. But as soon as the man went away
again she sneaked forward to lick up any
stray milk scum.</p>

<p>She felt enormously attracted by the man—and
long after he had left she wandered
about feeling a strange longing to make his
acquaintance.</p>

<p>One day she found an old brown switch,
which had been thrown on the field one winter
with the manure, and had now taken root
in the earth with its weather-beaten remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
twigs sticking up in the air. White-kitten
ran and rubbed herself against this
broom every time the man had been with
the calf!</p>

<p>In spite of the wild environment in which
she had grown up, White was quite tame.
Her dreams always centred round what
seemed to her the greatest luxuries in life:
dry shelter and delicious heat. Although
she had never been inside a house, she was
constantly obsessed with the idea of a warm
stove with glowing sides, before which she
lay curled up roasting herself.</p>

<p>One morning, when the crofter was bringing
milk to the calf, she could hold back no
longer. She left the shelter of the dock-leaves
and hopped quickly past him—but
stopped for a moment before bolting into
cover again.</p>

<p>The man called to her as she went; and
then, softening his voice and drawing out the
sound alluringly, he repeated, “Pu-s-s! Pu-s-s!”</p>

<p>It was the first time the kitten had ever
heard these human sounds—and the new,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
delightful music charmed her. She felt her
trust in mankind growing....</p>

<p>And the next time the man called she went
nearer still.</p>

<b><a id="newlink_205"></a>THE KITTENS HUNT BY NIGHT</b>
</h3>

<p>The September moon rises red-gold
and majestic from the mists of the
horizon, and lights up the harvested
fields where the five big kittens are stalking
their prey. They no longer hunt in a body,
but are spread out all over the field, working
independently....</p>

<p>A soft, many-hued light bathes the undulating
hills; only the hollows and valleys are
gloomy and colourless. Voices from the surrounding
homesteads echo through the motionless
air, mingling with the mooing of
calves and the bleating of lambs. The guns
of the duck-shooters drone faintly from the
marsh. But here among the barley stubble
where the partridge coveys settle, all is still
and silent....</p>

<p>Along one of the many paths left by the
broad wheel of the reaping-machine Grey-kitten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
glides, her whole soul absorbed in the
rustling of invisible mice....</p>

<p>Big is out after partridge; he hugs the
edge of the ditch, stopping frequently to peer
over the tall golden-rod and the knap-weed’s
empty pods. He sees the coveys of partridge
running to and fro among the rakings; the
young males are quarrelling, while the old
cock looks on and crows. His aim now is to
find out where they mean to “pack” for the
night.</p>

<p>Black hangs about near a drain-pipe in
which lives a fox-cub, with whom he hopes
to pick a quarrel! In the wood a few days
ago the cub had bagged a sparrow from right
under his nose—an event which upset the
kitten so terribly that he has quite lost his
appetite!</p>

<p>A little way off a flock of terrified sheep
stand gaping at him; they have heard his
weird hissing and spitting....</p>

<p>But on the top of the hill Tiny sits on a
stray sheaf and makes a grab with his paws
at every maybug that hums its way past. He
is waiting patiently for Black and Big to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
make a haul—when he hopes to get something
more satisfying to eat.</p>

<p>The moon, which immediately after rising
had dived into some black clouds, now thrusts
its yellow-green face from its sombre garments
and stares fixedly at White-kitten, who
has just finished a cheese-rind left behind
from the harvesters’ lunch.</p>

<p>White then discovers a tuft of grass, on
which an old woman has recently been sitting—and
begins rolling over and rubbing her
back on the place.</p>

<p>Red is nowhere to be seen—probably out
on one of her usual thieving raids in the
village.</p>

<p>The full moon again veils herself; and
then, peeping out for a moment, silhouettes
the form of an old cat on the turf-house roof.
The cat scrambles down the thatch and leaps
to the ground—then sneaks off in the direction
away from the kittens.</p>

<p>The kittens are now seldom seen together:
each spends the day according to his bent,
flitting along ditch and hedge, or nosing
around farm and outhouse. They all find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
their own food, using the means best suited to
their different natures and capabilities.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_208"></a>THE DEATH OF BOX</b>
</h3>

<p>Grey Puss becomes lazier and lazier, and
no longer takes the slightest interest in her
offsprings’ food difficulties. Whereas formerly
she used often to go hungry herself in
order to feed her kittens, she now almost invariably
devours her catch herself. Yes, it
has even happened that, upon surprising one
of the children with an extra tempting mouse,
she has taken rather than given! She behaves
all at once as if she were not their
mother at all.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Through the regiment of withered thistle-tops
lining the path by the marsh she patters
peacefully along to the broad high road,
where her grey coat soon disappears in the
twilight.</p>

<p>From the opposite direction Box comes
walking dejectedly. He is now no longer
the terror of the cat neighbourhood; and besides,
at the moment there burns inside him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
the strong but unsated fire of love. After a
three days’ fruitless vigil outside the vicarage
gates of a distant village he is now returning
home.</p>

<p>Without thought of evil he slinks leisurely
along the main road towards home, and has
just reached the bridge over the stream when
he finds himself suddenly face to face with
the “claw-beast,” who emerges from the
shadow at the side of the bridge with the intention
of crossing the road. Box, from force
of habit, gives the alarm, and charges
courageously forward—the cat straightens her
legs and becomes all at once big and glistening,
at the same time exploding with spits
and hisses....</p>

<p>When too late Box recognizes the ferocious
creature!</p>

<p>He has lately succeeded in convincing himself
that he no longer cares for gadding about
the fields after cats and other “vermin.”
And now, suddenly remembering his dearly
bought experience in connection with this
field-tiger’s claws, he makes his good resolution
an excuse for shunning the she-devil.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
The stream is handy—and he is not afraid of
<i>water</i>.</p>

<p>True, his canine self-respect protests, but
only for a moment; a glimpse of the curved
yellow-green claws, whose capacity for inflicting
pain he knows so well, gives him a sudden
sinking feeling—and the next moment he has
plunged into the water.</p>

<p>But he is mistaken in thinking that Grey
Puss will not follow him!</p>

<p>The brave little mother-cat, overwrought
as she is with the strain and anxiety of the
summer, is transformed into a fury at the
sound of her old tormentor’s ill-natured bark;
she springs after him, just as in his time he
has sprung after her—and seeing him like a
little floating island beneath her, she is seized
with the devilish inspiration to land on that
island.</p>

<p>With a beautifully judged spring she lands
with all four claw-bunches smack on the dog’s
forehead; and he disappears in a long, sudden
dive which stifles his howls of misery.</p>

<p>Now follows an extraordinary life-and-death
struggle!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>Box is quite mad with terror....</p>

<p>Every time he shows himself above water
the cat climbs up on his back from behind
and scratches and bites him so mercilessly
that he has no choice but to dive again.</p>

<p>He treads water, bristles up, and arches his
back; while Grey Puss spits, gurgles, and
splutters. He makes an attempt to bite;
but a claw plunges into his snout and stops
there....</p>

<p>He puts up a forepaw to free his snout; but
a lightning bite paralyses the paw....</p>

<p>He is breathing water now instead of air.
... He is slowly losing consciousness—but
the claw still hangs fast....</p>

<p>He flounders no longer; he sinks, but this
time he does not rise.... The poor old cat-nihilist
is reformed at last!</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_211"></a>HOME-SICKNESS</b>
</h3>

<p>Now that Box was dead Grey Puss had
only mankind to fear!</p>

<p>She hated mankind, which surpassed even
her in cunning and rapacity—and yet, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
could never forget that she had once been a
member of the human household.</p>

<p>Mankind was her strong, invincible rival!
Once for all, on the occasion when it had
lured her into the sack and flung her into the
water, it had imbued her with such terror of
its incredible treachery that she could not
bear to hear, smell, or see it. But none the
less in the depths of her soul she admired it
immensely....</p>

<p>She hated it, so that she could have torn its
throat asunder, and yet she loved it so intensely
that she erected her tail and purred
contentedly at the mere thought of rubbing
her back once more against a pair of trousered
legs.</p>

<p>This never-ceasing struggle between her
own personality and the instinct inherited
from a thousand generations of man-serving
ancestors was at times so intense that on
many a still, dark night she had sneaked home
to the farm fully determined to remain; but
at daybreak the rough sounds of wooden
clogs and men’s voices broke the spell, and
she had fled again to the fields....</p>

<b><a id="newlink_213"></a>THE DEMON MOUSER</b>
</h3>

<p>The crofter lived down by the marsh,
where he owned some fields with
blackish-brown soil, which he was
ploughing for the autumn sowing....</p>

<p>The ploughing progressed spasmodically;
for he had only one horse, and that a small
one, that had to stop every few minutes for
breath.</p>

<p>“Get along!” said the man to it lethargically....
“Gee up!”</p>

<p>But the horse declined; it considered that
it should be allowed a little longer respite.</p>

<p>“Gee up!” came the order again—and now
the man took hold of the reins which hung
loose on the horse’s back.</p>

<p>The nag continued to breathe heavily.
The whip had to be produced.</p>

<p>“Get along!... Gee up!”</p>

<p>The old crock lunged out behind and gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
a hop into the air—the preliminaries to starting.</p>

<p>At last they got going again.... Slowly,
very slowly, the ploughshare pushed up the
wet earth. The horse pulled itself together
and strained at the harness until the traces
quivered; it lunged with its legs and threw
its weight forward, making the plough go
faster and faster, so that the little man had to
hurry to keep pace, and once or twice had to
run.</p>

<p>Things went like a house afire for about
twenty yards; then the horse stopped abruptly—time
for another rest!</p>

<p>“First-rate!” thought the crofter—and
rested also.</p>

<p>Thus, each perfectly understanding the
other, they ploughed away patiently the whole
day long....</p>

<p>One evening the crofter stopped earlier
than usual.... The heavens were ablaze
and the horizon seethed with flame; the last
remnants of day were being cremated!</p>

<p>Having settled his assistant comfortably in
the stall, he set out over the hill to a meadow
where he had grazing rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>A little later he appeared again leading a
small red cow-calf, his bent back and bowed
legs silhouetted gnome-like against the sunset.</p>

<p>The weather was too cold now, besides being
too rough and stormy, to leave young
cattle out after dark!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After bolting the calf in, he stands a moment
outside his door and reads from a scrap
of newspaper. Suddenly he notices a slight
movement at his feet, and, looking down, sees
a little white kitten with arched back and
lifted tail rubbing itself affectionately against
his wooden clogs.</p>

<p>“Well I never! Where did you spring
from?”</p>

<p>White becomes nervous at hearing a
human voice and hops away a little. The
crofter bends down and makes coaxing noises
to her.</p>

<p>She comes nearer again, and now she feels
a hand grasp her round the body—how
deliciously it tickles!...</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The little farmer’s house, which formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
one with the stall and barn, was overrun with
mice. Of an evening when he sat reading
they would often come peeping over the edge
of the table and crawl over his trousers.</p>

<p>He never told how they behaved when he
was in bed!</p>

<p>At intervals he brought the farm-cat into
the rooms; but it never had the faintest notion
of what was required, and rushed about terrified,
knocking everything down until it was
let out again.</p>

<p>White-kitten, therefore, was not unwelcome!</p>

<p>She behaved at once as if she had lived in
a house all her life! She learned to chase
after mice on the chest-of-drawers without
overturning the shell-mounted frame containing
the photograph of the man in his soldier’s
uniform, and to catch flies on the table without
stepping into the dripping-dish or tea-mug.</p>

<p>She was industrious, affectionate, and anxious
to please, besides which, she knew when
to keep out of the way when not wanted. In
fact, she behaved in every respect just as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
slave nature in man prefers his dependents to
behave!</p>

<p>The mice soon disappeared completely!
Not because they were captured, but because
they could not endure the constant persecution....</p>

<p>And White was named the “demon
mouser!”</p>

the cloudy October dawn’s foul wet mists.</p>

<p>Outside the cow-stall, an old-fashioned
milk-jar with its narrow neck appears out of
the grey dawn. The milk-woman uses it
every morning to take a pint of milk home to
her children. A few traces of milk still cling
to the bottom—enough, at any rate, to tempt
a sweet-tooth!</p>

<p>The woman is inside milking, when Red
comes sneaking along the barn, catches sight
of the jar, sticks her nose in, and smells distinctly
the milk on the bottom. She rests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
her forepaws on the round, bulging body of
the vessel, and tries hard to push her head
through the narrow neck.</p>

<p>After several attempts she manages, by
turning her head vigorously from side to side,
to slide it in, her ears pressed tightly back
and her furry cheeks brushing the smooth
earthenware.</p>

<p>She has succeeded—and she licks the jar
cleaner than it has ever been before since the
day it was made.</p>

<p>Then she prepares to retreat. But now,
suddenly, she cannot get her head out; her
thick neck and gristly ears are wedged fast!
She becomes flurried ... and instead of trying
to wriggle out gently, she begins to tug
and wrestle; with the result that she fixes her
frightful mask more firmly still. She topples
over on her side, and rolls about clawing
dementedly at the stone cobbles—until at last
she regains her feet and staggers blindly into
the yard.</p>

<p>The weird figure is soon seen from one of
the windows. Now they’ve got her at last!</p>

<p>They recognize her at once—so a sack is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
soon fetched and slipped over her hind parts.
For now she shall be drowned!</p>

<p>Just then a rag and bone man turns into
the yard.</p>

<p>Once or twice a year he comes and buys
old rags and bottles, and all sorts of worthless
rubbish.</p>

<p>The fellow at once notices the cat’s shining
fox-red coat—and the quick-witted farmer
conceives a brilliant idea. The fellow has
cheated him so many times; now he shall be
paid back in his own coin!</p>

<p>With a cautious tap of the hammer he
releases the cat from the jar....</p>

<p>“Do you want to buy a splendid mouser?”</p>

<p>“You bet I do!” replies the ragged one ...
it was just what he was looking for.</p>

<p>The farmer piled on the agony. “Yes,
she’s a record killer! You will scarcely believe
it, but just before you came into the
yard, she nearly strangled herself capturing
a mouse which had dived into this milk-jar!”</p>

<p>The rag and bone man was completely
taken in; he bought the cat eagerly and immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>He put Red in his sack, and the two thieves
left the yard together.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_220"></a>BIG-KITTEN TURNS WILD CAT</b>
</h3>

<p>One autumn evening, as huge, billowy
clouds are drifting across the orange-gold
western sky, Big-cat wakes in his lair and
feels the call to action. The noise of day
has died from the fields, and the cows with
their watching eyes have gone to rest for the
night....</p>

<p>He slinks across naked, deserted fields,
where the wild camomile lifts its cheerful
face above the white-grey stubble. Like all
great hunters, he feels the need of a constant
change of hunting-grounds; hence his journey
through the cold, dry September night,
lighted by the pale, shining, half-grown
moon.</p>

<p>Over hill and along hawthorn hedge he
hurries; catches a lark in her nest, and a
mouse by a daring leap from a post—and at
daybreak lies down for his day’s rest behind a
yellow grass-tuft in a dry, secluded gravel-pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>Towards noon he is awakened by the sound
of paws in the shingle. He should just have
remained lying still among the grass—which
was grey-yellow and withered black in colour,
and not unlike his own marking—but he forgot
himself and ran.</p>

<p>The big, spotted hound got quite a shock;
he stepped for a moment and looked back.
Two men with guns, one of whom was
“Uncas’” master, were approaching, talking
together and pulling at their pipes.</p>

<p>Uncas seized his opportunity and tore after
the cat.</p>

<p>The men began shouting and whistling;
but as far as the dog was concerned the die
was cast. Nothing could stop him now—away
he went at a wild gallop!</p>

<p>Just ahead, the river flows in a long, graceful
curve, its cold, black waters scaring the
yellow autumnal landscape.</p>

<p>Big knows the river well; he knows, too,
that not even <i>his</i> jump can clear it. He
therefore makes for the wooden bridge.</p>

<p>The main road crosses the bridge....</p>

<p>When the cat is half-way over, he feels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the woodwork vibrate in a curious manner
beneath his feet; he sees a spitting, humming,
machine-animal whizzing towards him....</p>

<p>Just behind him is the dog, barking excitedly....</p>

<p>For a moment Big-cat hesitates; then, seeing
no alternative, leaps bravely between the
iron railings and falls with a splash into the
river.</p>

<p>He sinks like a stone through the water,
but the moment it closes over his head he
commences kicking instinctively with his legs.
At last he gets air again; he sees the sky above
him. He swims mechanically—but believes
that he is running through the water....</p>

<p>The motor-cycle rushed on over the bridge—the
dog crossed its path; a howl, a crash,
oaths and curses....</p>

<p>Meanwhile a dripping, bedraggled cat
galloped away across the fields. He shook
himself, and ran, and then shook himself
again.... He has managed to come out on
top as usual!</p>

<p>He kept on at full speed until he reached
the boundaries of a large, private wood some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
distance away, by which time his fur was
quite dry from his exertions. After several
vain attempts he succeeded in scaling the tall,
wooden palisade surrounding the wood, and,
plunging in among the trees, soon came to a
tumble-down game-keeper’s hut, in the loft of
which he remained in comfort for a week.</p>

<p>From here he made excursions in all directions;
but the old willow stump and the long,
winding hawthorn hedge were no longer in
sight to remind him to return, and with the
disappearance of these and other landmarks
the threads that bound him to his home
snapped for ever.</p>

<p>He drifted farther and farther away out
into the wide world, and finished his career
as wild cat in a distant deer park.</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_223"></a>THE HOME OF THE FISHERMAN</b>
</h3>

<p>After leaving the village the main road
rose over the brow of the hill and ran down
again between rich, fertile fields until it
crossed the river which hugged the valley.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the hill a small, idyllic
brook had once flowed into the river, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
had dried up, leaving behind only the shallow
watercourse, which now served as a drain.</p>

<p>The road crossed the river by means of a
flint-paved bridge, and swung round a fisherman’s
cottage before continuing farther across
country.</p>

<p>The fisherman had been a widower for
thirteen years, and he had lived in the house
for twenty—so that he knew its ins and outs
fairly well. A small garden and a few rods
of ploughed land supplied potatoes for him
and oats for his horse. Three or four times
a week he drove round the countryside selling
the fish he caught in the fjord. It was a
long way for the horse to pull—sometimes as
much as twenty-five or thirty miles a day; but
in return the beast was often allowed to slack
for several days on end.</p>

<p>The gables of the building faced east-west,
and all its doors and its small windows opened
towards the south.</p>

<p>The west end, which was nearest the road,
formed the stall and pigsty—in which a pig
was always grunting. The outhouse, consisting
of woodshed and barn, was situated on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
the east, from which direction the winter
storms usually raged. Between the two nestled
the inhabited quarter, comprising corridor,
tiny kitchen, and living-room.</p>

<p>For seven years it had been vouchsafed the
fisherman to live in this room with his wife;
then she died, leaving behind her seven children,
who had long since deserted the parental
roof. From the quiet, peaceful countryside
to which their father clung with his
whole nature, they had emigrated to the big
town, which they could not imagine themselves
leaving.</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough of all that fuss with children,”
said the fisherman. “Thank goodness
it’s over and done with!”</p>

<p>Now he lived totally alone. He kept the
house in order himself, and made the food
himself—and smoked his way with cheap
tobacco through the long, winter evenings.</p>

<p>It was quite cosy in the living-room, where
a pair of large pictures of himself and his
wife when young hung on the wall, and where
the inevitable soldier-photographs of the boys—who
all later on became navvies or brick-layers—stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
upon the chest-of-drawers. In
the window beneath the short cotton curtains
stood well-tended pot-plants on neat wooden
stands.... It was all meagre enough, but
decent and orderly.</p>

<p>In addition to the horse, which was the old
man’s jewel, and the pig, which was treated
as a son, he owned a little dog called Bibs.
The latter guarded the house when his master
was away.</p>

<p>Bibs reigned in the living-room. Outside—in
the stall, barn, and loft—a cat was in
command; but in reality the post was vacant,
for old Peter, with his pale, lack-lustre eyes
and moth-eaten tail, was now so decrepit and
worn-out that he could no longer hear
whether mice or other vermin scratched or
not.</p>

<p>For fourteen years the cat had lived with
the fisherman, who alleged that he was so
intelligent that he understood what was said
to him. For instance, if the cat sat by the
stove and the man bent down and shouted,
“Peter, get out!” he got up and went out.</p>

<p>He always ran to meet the fish-cart when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
it came home from the fishing-place laden
with eels or herring—and as reward the
fisherman would fling him a squab or a dab,
or perhaps a small eel. He could recognize
the horse’s trot from a great distance, and
when it came in sight he miauwed with delight,
opening his mouth so wide that one
could see far down into his stomach.</p>

<p>In his palmy days he used to run a mile
along the road to meet the cart—but now he
could only manage a couple of hundred
yards.</p>

<p>Peter was the apple of the fisherman’s eye,
and Grey would never have found favour
with him had not the old cat himself received
his successor, when she suddenly walked in
one freezing autumn morning, with the utmost
graciousness.</p>

<p>For Grey-kitten was a lady, and old Mr.
Peter’s ingrained tendency towards gallantry
acquired new life at the sight of the pretty,
little, long-eared pussy-cat. A golden gleam
filled the fellow’s pale eyes, and the fisherman
often saw the stiff, rheumatic old tyke
sitting for hours at a time under a tree up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
which his new, agile little lodger had fled.</p>

<p>But one day when it is raining hard, Grey-kitten
cannot escape from the old stink-pot;
she has to run up into the hayloft.</p>

<p>Peter crawls up the ladder in pursuit, and
Grey springs out of the window on to a headless
poplar growing beside the house.</p>

<p>Peter, forgetting his age, makes a rash leap
after her ... but misses his footing and falls
into the water.</p>

<p>However, he is quickly on land again,
where he sits down and waits faithfully under
the tree in which the object of his senile affection
is enthroned.</p>

<p>He shakes with cold, but endures bravely—and
when the fisherman returns home in
the evening, he finds his old comrade still
sitting there, stiff and dead....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After that Grey inherited his office as a
matter of course, and as time passed succeeded
in discharging it entirely to her master’s satisfaction.</p>

<p>She was called “Puss” and “Pussy-girl”—and
she had a busy time ridding the old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
neglected hovel of mice. She soon made
herself at home in the stall, barn, and loft,
which were just as dark and dirty as the
burial-mound and the willow bole.</p>

<p>One day, only six months later, she came
running with her tail proudly hoisted, to meet
the old fisherman as he was driving home,
and jumped up beside him in the cart. And
then, after the horse had been put in the stall
and the fish-boxes unloaded, she was given
two or three little eels or dabs.</p>

<p>Fish had always been her favourite food!</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_229"></a>BLACK JOINS THE ARMY</b>
</h3>

<p>At last “Madness” has succeeded in coming
to grips with the young fox....</p>

<p>They do battle on a grassy field, bounded
on one side by yellow straw and on the other
by dried-up, rust-coloured clover.</p>

<p>Black crouches on three legs, swaying his
doubled-up body, and prepares to give Reynard
a sample of his patent attack, when
suddenly the earth shakes with the beat of a
horse’s hoof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>The beats come nearer ... and become
quicker and quicker.</p>

<p>The two madcaps call a truce and listen....</p>

<p>The hoof-beats are coming straight towards
them—and now they can see the head of a
horse with its rider.</p>

<p>The young fox slips instantly into the nearest
ditch—its instinct is sure—but Black, who
feels bound to find a wood or tree, tears off
along the path. With tail on one side he
chases along, easily visible among the withered
grass.</p>

<p>The horseman is an artilleryman from an
adjacent garrison town, a young sergeant out
exercising his colonel’s horse. The poor
beast was so seldom allowed to let himself go—here
was a splendid chance....</p>

<p>The speed of the cat, as it gallops along
the path, infects the man; he digs his spurs
deep in Tambourine’s sides, and away they
go as hard as the horse can pelt.</p>

<p>Black puts his ears back and makes springs
fully three times his own length. He feels
like a hare in front of an express train. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
eyes are magnetized to the smooth, open path
before him; he cannot, if he would, leave it
to plunge aside into the corn. A tree he
<i>must</i> have—and trees are not found until the
hedge is reached; already he can see one; his
claws itch to bury themselves in its bark!</p>

<p>Suddenly he rolls over and over! His
brain, which keeps running on trees, has just
time to complete the thought, “Now, you’ve
fallen down!” when a kick on the head
knocks him senseless. He remains lying in
the path, his whiskers twitching, his legs kicking
spasmodically....</p>

<p>Tambourine, who has joyfully given every
muscle full play during his reckless gallop,
jumps clean over his victim, causing the supple
rider to fling himself backwards in the
saddle. The man catches a glimpse of what
has happened, pulls up, turns, and dismounts.</p>

<p>“What a shame! Poor little beast!”</p>

<p>He picks up the cat by its tail between his
forefinger and thumb, and turns its body
round. It bleeds neither at the nose nor at
the mouth, but it does not move a hair. The
sergeant feels it to see whether any bones are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
broken, then holds it by the scruff and examines
its yellow eyes. Yes, it must be dead,
after all—probably from a hoof-kick....
Well, to blazes with the beast!</p>

<p>He is just about to fling it in the ditch when
the cat’s smooth, jet-black coat catches his
attention!</p>

<p>“By Jove, what a splendid skin! That’s
sure to be useful!” And without further ado
he opens the left saddle-bag and lets the lifeless
“Madness” sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>The old saddle-bag is worn thin, and the
inside seam nearest the horse is gaping; but
what does it matter—a cat, and what’s more,
a dead cat, is safe enough there!</p>

<p>And the man pulls the strap extra tight.</p>

<p>Tambourine has been ordered a good run
this morning, so that he shall go quietly at
the next morning’s general inspection—and
when at last, sweating and frothing with
dilated nostrils, he is walking homewards
towards the barracks, the reins hang loose on
his neck.</p>

<p>Suddenly he feels some pointed “spurs”
prod him in the side....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>The skittish thoroughbred, who shies at a
mere touch of the curb, now receives one
“spur” jab after another! He gives a leap,
and bucks sideways like a flash of lightning,
and the sergeant, who is totally unprepared,
reels out of the saddle.</p>

<p>“Madness” has recovered consciousness,
and, true to his nature, pays back the horse in
his own coin. His disturbed state of mind,
rendered still more frantic by the darkness of
the saddle-bag, finds the necessary outlet in
his claws and teeth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tambourine, riderless and
with flapping reins, gallops away to the barracks,
where he is captured. He had probably
bolted from the sergeant, they thought,
while that worthy was swallowing a “corpse-reviver”
at an inn!</p>

<p>“Give him a good rub down and afterwards
let him have some water!” comes a
roar from the office where the “Staff” sits and
administers. He has heard the horse thundering
round for some time, and now sticks
his fat, bald head through the door....</p>

<p>The long-aproned stable orderly bangs his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
heels together with a “Very good, sir!” gives
the hunter a couple of soothing pats on the
flanks, and leads him away.</p>

<p>But the orderly nearly had a fit when, unsaddling
the horse, he saw a coal-black cat
flash out of one of the saddle-bags and leap
towards him; he thought it was the evil one
himself....</p>

<p>With a furious hiss “Madness” sprang over
the man’s shoulder, ran along the side of the
manger, and leapt out in the middle of the
stable.... He was in a terribly battered
state, and felt utterly confused by his new
surroundings. The fall from the tree, which
was the beginning of his misfortunes, seemed
to have spirited him into another world. He
hid himself in a corner under some hay, and
spat out venomous oaths at all who
approached.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the sergeant returned home he came
very near smashing in “Madness’” head with
his sword—not unnaturally his feelings towards
the cat were the reverse of friendly!
But the battery commander, who came in at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
the moment and heard the story, regarded the
black devil as sent from heaven.</p>

<p>Weren’t the old barrack stables simply
swarming with rats and mice? It would be
a splendid thing to have a cat which was
worth its salt!</p>

<p>The tall, bony battery commander stood
looking down searchingly at the savage, coal-black
beast as it crouched glaring at him with
its wicked, yellow-green eyes.... Suddenly
with a ferocious scowl he thrust his long,
heavy riding-boot right in the cat’s face.</p>

<p>But neither the scowl nor the boot frightened
Black: a claw transfixed the patent
leather, while sharp fangs bit into the uppers....</p>

<p>“Damn it, if he isn’t a soldier!” exclaimed
the commander—and the cat’s fortune was
made.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Living among these strong, healthy men
Black performed prodigies of valour....</p>

<p>He wasn’t satisfied with catching one rat at
a time—but usually managed one with each
claw-bunch. Indeed, occasionally when someone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
took the trouble to shift the oat-bin for
him, he had been know to secure a third with
his jaws. He became less wild after a time,
and would even allow himself to be stroked
and picked up—and here, where the idea of
madness was unknown, he was christened
anew: they called him “Fizz.”</p>


<h3 class="right s12">
<b><a id="newlink_236"></a>“TERROR” TURNS HOUSE-CAT</b>
</h3>

<p>At the cross-roads some way from the
village lived the midwife.</p>

<p>She was a slim, fair person, with large
eyes and thick, curly hair.</p>

<p>She was not so fearfully old; but neither
was she so fearfully young; in short, she was
a lady in the prime of life.</p>

<p>She had never taken a husband to herself,
although there had been plenty of suitors—the
snug little home and the smart, pretty
girl were tempting enough for anyone.</p>

<p>Why she had not married was the secret
of her life; and everyone in the neighbourhood
had tried to guess it!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One evening in late autumn, when storm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
and rain raged without, there came to her a
little kitten in the last stages of exhaustion,
which crept into the shelter of the outhouse
and next morning introduced itself to her as
a new arrival into the world.</p>

<p>It was extremely timid, but starving and
hungry—it gulped down everything she
placed before it.</p>

<p>She saw that it was a little spotted he-cat
with almost as many colours as the rainbow,
and with a tail so long that it could wind it
round the neck like a feather-boa.</p>

<p>The midwife adopted “Terror,” not because
she was particularly fond of cats, but because
of late she had begun to feel so terribly
lonely....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After Black’s departure from home Tiny
had a very rough time. He was soon pursued
by hunger, and there was no one there to help
him, for his other brothers and sisters had
also left. Even Grey Puss, who occasionally
let him share her spoil, had vanished without
trace.</p>

<p>One day, just as he is sneaking through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
doorway of the turf-house—under whose
mouldering thatch he still remains—he finds
himself suddenly face to face with a tall, two-legged
being who is too big for him to see
all at once. The man throws his coat over
him and he disappears as into the blackest
night. He is squeezed and stifled, and meanwhile
carried along—until at last he succeeds
in diving head first through a long, dangling
nozzle—a coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>Then he ran, and ran—and never knew
what fate he escaped!</p>

<p>He hid in a turnip-field, where for a time
he dragged out a wretched, half-starved existence.
His lonely expeditions in company
with Black had taught him to avoid the dwellings
of mankind; and it was not until hunger
conquered fear that he dared to enter the
cottage.</p>

<p>His position as midwife’s cat suited “Terror”
down to the ground—his complete inability
to earn his own living excused him
from rendering his mistress the slightest
assistance!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Later on, the midwife discovered that she
had a living barometer in the house—a fact
which raised his value in her eyes enormously!
She always consulted him before setting out
on her duties.</p>

<p>As regards his humorous tendencies, they
too came into their own—but not before a
very painful accident occurred.</p>

<p>One day when the wind was playing with
the outhouse door, “Terror” suddenly felt the
door bite his tail! He whirled round immediately
and let fly with his claws—that
helped matters. The door opened its mouth
and he was free!</p>

<p>But in spite of that, the tail still felt as if
it were held fast; he ran round and round
with a pain all over his body—and later on
a red, swollen ring appeared round the
appendage.</p>

<p>At last the tail-end withered away and fell
off; and where the red ring had been, a tuft
of hair sprouted over a black spot.</p>

<p>Tiny-kitten had become still tinier!</p>

<p>But his luxurious mode of living made his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
stomach fat and his body broad and short—which,
taken in conjunction with his extra
hairy ears and his stumpy tail, gave him a
strong resemblance to a young lynx. The
good midwife’s clients, who not infrequently
suffered from the most frightful delusions,
often mistook him for one in their excited
state of mind....</p>

<p>Many an idle evening in the cottage by the
cross-road did the still pretty spinster sit in
cosy companionship with the kitten, thinking
over her life’s secret. Should she have married
Thorkild Skov after all—he was now a
well-to-do butcher? Or Frederik Hansen—he
was now owner of Hill Farm? Or ...
ah, she had had so many wooers once upon a
time!</p>

<p>No, no, she thought, jumping up restlessly—far
better off as she was! All that terrible
fuss over the arrival of each little citizen into
the world, with which she had been in such
close contact since her early girlhood, had
quite frightened her.</p>

<p>She sat down again and fell into deep
thought, her hand gently stroking “Terror’s”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
soft fur, as he lay purring on the sofa at her
side....</p>

<p>And yet—she sighed deeply—and yet, she
wished in spite of all that she had not been
so afraid of <i>life</i>!</p>

<b><a id="newlink_242"></a>GREY PUSS’ FUTURE</b>
</h3>

<p>The late autumn showers were beginning....
Heavy, violet-blue clouds
swollen with moisture drifted about—and
often two rainbows stood simultaneously
one behind the other in the sky.</p>

<p>Grey Puss could no longer forage in the
fields—it was wet and muddy everywhere.</p>

<p>The wretched wild bees, whose earth-hive
she had dug up, hastened to cover their remnants
of honey with layers of moss....</p>

<p>The chirp of grasshoppers and the buzzing
of mosquitoes no longer filled the night
air; unquiet and discomfort reigned in their
stead. The cows mooed for shelter and the
young cattle coughed and sneezed with cold—whilst
the bulls in the meadows boomed
deeply and mournfully.</p>

<p>The fields became more and more deserted,
and the ditches and hedges more muddy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
bare; only the shelter in the lee of the rising
stacks grew and grew.</p>

<p>Mice were also scarce! The lucky ones
had completed the miraculous journey with
the wagon, hidden in the middle of the
sheaves, after having successfully evaded the
eagerly sniffing noses of the farm dogs. The
others were now emigrating towards the big
“human” dwellings.... They scented the
warm, heavy odour from the stacks and
followed in the wake of the corn.</p>

<p>And Grey Puss followed in the wake of
the mice; and came each evening a little
nearer to the farm ... the dear old farm
with its dry beams and warm, quiet barns.</p>

<p>She longs to move among the cobwebs in
the loft once more, to hear the everlasting
rushing of the wind through its thatch. Most
of all she thinks of the pot-bellied, piebald
tomcat, whose drawling, wailing love-song
seems to her irresistibly alluring. With
every day that passes she seems to hear his
pleading voice more and more plainly, and
she sees him in her mind’s eye with his restless,
swinging tail and his wild, burning
eyes....</p>

<p>One October evening, when all colours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
have withered from the marshes and the deep,
black shadows along the tufted banks make
the water gleam still more brightly, Grey Puss
slinks home through the fields towards Hill
Farm.</p>

<p>All day the long waggons have rocked their
loads of yellow turnips along to the shelter of
the poplars, where the turnip-heaps grow in
size and number.</p>

<p>She watches the tame cats sit in ambush at
the foot of the stacks. They have only to sit
there and doze, and the mice, which are not
yet accustomed to their elevated residence,
will tumble down on their heads.</p>

<p>Listen! The children are singing in the
farm.... “Three blind mice; see how they
run.”... Dear little children, who used so
often to play with her when she was a tiny
kitten in the house, and give her sweet milk to
drink!</p>

<p>But now the dog is barking ... a new Box
probably—one she has not yet seen. And
clogs clatter suddenly on the bridge—no, no,
she <i>can</i> not, she <i>dare</i> not—she must go out to
the fields again....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>But she longs....</p>

<p>In the turf-house loft, as well as in the
burial-mound, and down in the willow bole—where
she has also paid a visit—all is cold
and lonely and full of damp and discomfort.</p>

<p>She longs for the spacious, broken-down
farm loft, where the moss-covered thatch
clings to the broad, low chimney-stacks;
where the clay-lined walls are warping and
the small-paned windows hang askew.</p>

<p><i>There</i> is her real home, the home of her
race....</p>

<p>The new farm-buildings, where bricks replace
clay and wood, don’t attract her; they
are much too cold, and too clean! No; where
there are hatchways instead of doors, hooks
instead of locks, pegs and staples instead of
keys, that is where she feels at home. She
can always be relied upon to find her way
in through some split in the roof, some air-hole
in the wall....</p>

<p>And the “cunning ones”? Oh, perhaps it
would not be so bad to live among them again,
after all!</p>

<p>Yet another week she hesitates on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
threshold—then one afternoon her longing
for the room, with all its sweet memories of
kittenhood, overwhelms her....</p>

<p>A storm raged over the fields! It swept
hissing along the shaggy ditches and writhed
screaming and whistling through hedge and
fence.</p>

<p>At one moment whitish-grey, swollen
masses of cloud came pouring like a flood of
liquid lead across the sky, to fling down a
shower of seething rain ... at another the
clouds split and parted, and the sun created
heaven out of chaos: a strip of blue appeared,
a stream of dazzling light—and the earth
broke into a smile of joy!</p>

<p>For one short minute the farm’s white
gables and moss-green roofs with their frame
of yellow poplar-tops sprang into life and
colour....</p>

<p>Then the picture broke, shattered into a
thousand fragments; the white gable, the
whole farm, sank into the ground—and once
more the rain fell in torrents.</p>

<p>A storm raged over the fields; all creatures
fled for shelter—and Grey Puss had to hie her
to the willow bole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>She shivered as she sat there with eyes half-closed
and tail curled round her paws....
She was day-dreaming: it is early spring, and
she lies in the shelter of the kitchen garden,
sunning herself and rolling to and fro on the
warm ground. Suddenly her old prize-fighter
is sitting before her! She goes crazy
with delight, and rolls with still greater
abandon from side to side on her back.</p>

<p>He sits before her ready to spring....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A new, violent shower drummed on the old
willow bole’s withered bark and tore her from
her dreams. Wet spray from the raindrops
splashed in her eyes....</p>

<p>She had never been a mother to kittens ...
she had never had a grudge against the “cunning
ones!” She thus deadens her conscience,
for she is drawn irresistibly to the place where
she was born and bred—to the shelter of the
stall, the barn, or at a pinch, the roof.</p>

<p>That evening a red, flaming shaft of sunlight
pierces the ragged horizon. Long,
black wisps of cloud hang across the heavens
and draw a veil over the frost-moon’s cold,
curved sickle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>At midnight she makes her return to the
farm, following the familiar path over the
pigsty roof, through the trap-door, and up
into the loft over the cow-stall. She feels the
warm air enfold her; the sweet, delicious
odour of hay and fresh, dry straw meets her
nostrils. The soothing chewing of the cows
sounds beneath her....</p>

<p>There comes a rustling in the straw—and
the multicoloured he-cat steps forward and
greets her with every sign of delight. He
springs towards her and strokes his cheek lovingly
along her side right from her neck to
her tail.... She is welcome to the farm; she
is <i>home</i>!</p>

<p>As she gazes at him, it seems suddenly as if
the whole kitten flock is standing before her.</p>

<p>She sees them all in him: Black’s temper,
Tiny’s fur, Big’s strength, and White’s cunning.
Like Grey, he is patient and shrewd;
and fully as reckless, if not so active, as Red.</p>

<p>“Auw-auw ... ooh ... uuh!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And she fell in love with him once more—the
dear, old spotted darling!
